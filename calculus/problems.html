Section 5.1
The language "local maximum point". This means (a,f(a)). It does not introduce the language local max of f(a) at a. Later in the optimization section this missing language is used.

Section 5.1
Based on the text it is impossible to decide if x |-> sqrt(x) had a local extrema or not. It completely ignores restrictions and finite closed domains. Again this issue comes up in the optimization section.
