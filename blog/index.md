## Personal Blog Posts
I write sporadically on my personal blog. Topics focus on mathematics, teaching, and technology. Posts are listed in reverse chronological order.

<div>
<ul>
{% for post in site.posts %}
<li>{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}: <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
