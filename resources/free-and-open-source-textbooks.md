Here is a partial list of free and/or open-source textbooks. If you find one of these more helpful than another, please <a href="mailto:dana.ernst@nau.edu">let me know</a>. Also, take a peek at [Rob Beezer’s](http://buzzard.ups.edu) selection on [this page](http://linear.ups.edu/curriculum.html). Moreover, the [American Institute of Mathematics](http://www.aimath.org) maintains a list of [approved open-source textbooks](http://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/).  Also, check out the free computer science books by [Allen B. Downey](http://www.allendowney.com/wp/) (Olin College) at [Green Tea Press](https://greenteapress.com/wp/).  Downey's [Textbook manifesto](https://greenteapress.com/wp/textbook-manifesto/) is definitely worth reading.

### Calculus ###
  * [CLP Calculus Textbooks](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~CLP/index.html) by [Joel Feldman](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~feldman/), [Andrew Rechnitzer](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~andrewr/front_page.html), and [Elyse Yeager](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~elyse/index.html) were written for standard university calculus courses at the University of British Colombia.  Free PDF and web-based textbooks.
  * [APEX Calculus](http://www.apexcalculus.com) is an open-source textbook by a group of faculty from Virginia Military Institute.  It has the look and feel of a traditional calculus (e.g., Stewart's *Calculus*). Includes interactive 3D graphics.
  * [MOOCulus Textbook](https://ximera.osu.edu) is a free textbook from the [MOOCulus](https://mooculus.osu.edu/) folks at Ohio State University. This text is mostly an adaptation of the Community Calculus text listed below.
  * [Community Calculus](https://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/calculus/) by [David Guichard](http://skink.whitman.edu/~guichard/) (Whitman College). This one is also available as a free PDF. You can also purchase a very inexpensive hardcopy from [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/whitmancalculus).
  * [Active Calculus](http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/Download.html) by [Matt Boelkins](http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/MB.html) (Grand Valley State College). This is one of the newer additions to the list of free calculus texts.
  * [Coordinated Calculus](https://mathbooks.unl.edu/Calculus/) by [Nathan Wakefield](https://math.unl.edu/nwakefield2) (University of Nebraska) et al. This is the calculus textbook used at the Univerisity of Nebraska. Based upon Active Calculus by Matthew Boelkins (see above).

  * [Contemporary Calculus](http://scidiv.bellevuecollege.edu/dh/Calculus_all/Calculus_all.html) by [Dale Hoffman](http://scidiv.bellevuecollege.edu/dh/) (Bellevue Community College).  A free online calculus text that is being developed for the [Open Course Library Project of the Washington State Colleges](http://opencourselibrary.org).  This book is part of the foundation for the previous book.  It covers three semesters of calculus and seems to do a thorough job of it, but the formatting is awful.
