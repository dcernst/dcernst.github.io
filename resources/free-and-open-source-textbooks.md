Here is a partial list of free and/or open-source textbooks. If you find one of these more helpful than another, please <a href="mailto:dana.ernst@nau.edu">let me know</a>. Also, take a peek at [Rob Beezer’s](http://buzzard.ups.edu) selection on [this page](http://linear.ups.edu/curriculum.html). Moreover, the [American Institute of Mathematics](http://www.aimath.org) maintains a list of [approved open-source textbooks](http://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/).  Also, check out the free computer science books by [Allen B. Downey](http://www.allendowney.com/wp/) (Olin College) at [Green Tea Press](https://greenteapress.com/wp/).  Downey's [Textbook manifesto](https://greenteapress.com/wp/textbook-manifesto/) is definitely worth reading.  There are also lots of free textbooks available at [LibreTexts](https://math.libretexts.org).

### Calculus ###
  * [Calculus for Team-Based Inquiry Learning](https://teambasedinquirylearning.github.io/calculus/) by TBIL Institute Fellows. Activities and exercises for easily implementing Team-Based Inquiry Learning in a single-variable calculus classroom. PDF and HTML versions.
  * [CLP Calculus Textbooks](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~CLP/index.html) by [Joel Feldman](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~feldman/), [Andrew Rechnitzer](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~andrewr/front_page.html), and [Elyse Yeager](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~elyse/index.html) were written for standard university calculus courses at the University of British Colombia.  Free PDF and web-based textbooks.
  * [APEX Calculus](http://www.apexcalculus.com) is an open-source textbook by a group of faculty from Virginia Military Institute.  It has the look and feel of a traditional calculus (e.g., Stewart's *Calculus*). Includes interactive 3D graphics.
  * [Open Source Calculus and Analysis](https://oscalculusandanalysis.ugent.be) by a group of faculty at Ghent University. This book substantially builds on APEX Calculus. As compared to the APEX Calculus, it comes with precalculus, more formalism, proofs of most theorems (and more theorems), differential equations, computer laboratories, review exercises, built-in code for symbolic computation, and many other things. It's tailored to students in engineering programs. Multiple free PDFs available for download.
  * [MOOCulus Textbook](https://ximera.osu.edu/mooculus) is a free textbook from the [Ximera](https://ximera.osu.edu/) folks at Ohio State University. This text is mostly an adaptation of the Community Calculus text listed below.
