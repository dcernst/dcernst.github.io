My name is Dana Ernst and I am an associate professor in the <a href="http://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/">Department of Mathematics and Statistics</a> at <a href="http://nau.edu">Northern Arizona University</a> in <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Flagstaff,+AZ&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=57.161276,109.511719&amp;oq=fl&amp;hnear=Flagstaff,+Coconino,+Arizona&amp;t=m&amp;z=12">Flagstaff, AZ</a>.

My primary research interests are in the interplay between combinatorics and algebraic structures. More specifically, I study the combinatorics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter_group">Coxeter groups</a> and their associated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecke_algebra">Hecke algebras</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazhdan%E2%80%93Lusztig_polynomial">Kazhdan-Lusztig theory</a>, generalized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperley-Lieb_algebra">Temperley-Lieb algebras</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_algebra">diagram algebras</a>, and <a href="https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~kratt/artikel/heaps.pdf">heaps of pieces</a>. By employing combinatorial tools such as diagram algebras and heaps of pieces, one can gain insight into algebraic structures associated to Coxeter groups, and, conversely, the corresponding structure theory can often lead to surprising combinatorial results. More recently, my research has expanded into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory">combinatorial game theory</a> (joint with <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/ns46/">Nandor Sieben</a> and <a href="http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~bbenesh/">Bret Benesh</a>).  In particular, our research has focused on avoidance and achievement games involving finite groups.  See my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/scholarship/">scholarship page</a> for more information.

The combinatorial nature of my research naturally lends itself to collaborations with undergraduate students, and my goal is to incorporate undergraduates in my research as much as possible. Check out my [undergraduate research page]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholarship/undergraduate-research/) for examples of recent projects.

My interests also include the [scholarship of teaching and learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship_of_Teaching_and_Learning) (SoTL) with a focus on [inquiry-based learning](http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html) (IBL) as an approach to teaching/exploring mathematics. I am currently Co-Director for the [Academy of Inquiry-Based Learning](http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org) and a mentor for several new IBL practitioners.  Moreover, I actively give [talks]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholarship/talks/) and organize workshops on the benefits of IBL as well as the nuts and bolts of how to implement this approach in the mathematics classroom.

In addition to using free and open-source software, I am inspired by the recent [open-source textbook](http://iae-pedia.org/Open_Source_Textbooks) movement and I strongly believe that educators should choose free, open-source, or low cost textbooks when viable alternatives exist. For a selection of free and/or open-source textbooks, see my list located [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/free-and-open-source-textbooks/). Moreover, the [American Institute of Mathematics](http://www.aimath.org) maintains a list of [approved open-source textbooks](https://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/).

<!-- Besides the occasional [blog posts]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/) I write for this site, from Fall 2016 through Fall 2017, I was a co-editor and author for the online column [Teaching Tidbits](http://maateachingtidbits.blogspot.com), which is sponsored by the [Mathematical Association of America](http://maa.org). From Spring 2013 through Spring 2016, I was co-editor and author for [Math Ed Matters](http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com), which is a another online column sponsored by the [MAA](http://maa.org). My [academic writing page]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholarship/academic-writing/) includes a list of the posts that I've written for various online venues. I am also a co-editor for [Mathblogging.org](http://mathblogging.org/about/), which is a site devoted to aggregating the multitude of math-related blogs and news sources across the Internet. -->

I am a husband and a father of two incredible sons. My passions include cycling and rock climbing.  I try to do a few ultra endurance mountain bike events each year.  You can follow my cycling endeavors on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/122321). Oh, I enjoy drinking copious amounts of coffee, too.

Flagstaff and NAU sit at the base of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks">San Francisco Peaks</a>, on homelands sacred to Native Americans throughout the region.  The Peaks, which includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak">Humphreys Peak</a> (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona, have religious significance to several Native American tribes. In particular, the Peaks form the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo">Diné</a> (Navajo) sacred mountain of the west, called Dook'o'oosłííd, which means "the summit that never melts". The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi">Hopi</a> name for the Peaks is Nuva'tukya'ovi, which translates to "place-of-snow-on-the-very-top". The land in the area surrounding Flagstaff is the ancestral homeland of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi">Hopi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Apache_people">Ndee/Nnēē</a> (Western Apache), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavapai">Yavapai</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuni_people">A:shiwi</a> (Zuni Pueblo), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo">Diné</a> (Navajo). We honor their past, present, and future generations, who have lived here for millennia and will forever call this place home.
