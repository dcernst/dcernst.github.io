<h2>Course Information and Policies</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>A satisfactory grade in MA2560 (or MA2500 with consent of instructor).</p>

<h3>Course description</h3>
<p>This is the third course in the calculus sequence. Loosely speaking, Calculus III revisits the topics from Calculus I and II, but explores them in multiple dimensions.  Topics include three-dimensional vectors, directional derivatives and the gradient, and multiple integrals.  Some key theorems include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green's_theorem">Green's Theorem</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem">Stokes' Theorem</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem">Divergence Theorem</a>. We will occasionally make use of software packages, like <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/" target="_blank"> Sage</a>, which is capable of doing symbolic mathematics.</p>

<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p>We will be using <i>Calculus</i>, 6th edition (Thomson/Brooks Cole) by James Stewart.  There are two different versions that you can choose from.  One option is to obtain the <a href="http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?Ntt=9780495011606&Ntk=P_Isbn13&N=+16+4294922413+4294967225+4294967224+4294967223+4294967218">full textbook</a>.  The second option is to obtain the <a href="http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?Ntt=calculus+multivariable||9780495011637&N=16&Ntk=all%7C%7CP_Isbn13">multivariable version</a> of the book, which consists of chapters of 13-18.  <i>Note:</i> This is not the same book that I am using for Calculus I and II.  I expect you to be <i>reading</i> the textbook.  I will not be covering every detail of the textbook and the only way to achieve a sufficient understanding of the material is to be digesting the reading in a meaningful way.  You should be seeking clarification about the material in the textbook whenever necessary by asking questions in class or posting questions to the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/webapp/courses/course/view.php?id=15986" target="_blank">course forum</a> on our Moodle page.</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>We will have two types of homework assignments.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Daily Homework:</b> Daily Homework will be assigned each lecture day (typically Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), and will be due the following lecture day.  Students are expected to complete (or try their best to complete) each assignment before the due date.  For the most part, the exercises for the Daily Homework will consist of problems from the textbook.  Daily Homework will be graded on a $\checkmark$-system.  There will be approximately 30-33 Daily Homework assignments and five (possibly more) of your lowest homework scores will be dropped.  Your overall Daily Homework grade will be worth 15% of your final grade.</li>

<li><b>Weekly Homework:</b> Mathematics is about so much more than cranking out answers to assigned exercises.  Having the ability to appropriately convey a mathematical argument is equally as important as "getting the right answer."  In fact, I would argue that it is one of the most important reasons for learning mathematics.  Each week, you will be required to submit carefully written solutions to a selection of problems.  The write-ups will be graded for more than the correct answer.  In particular, intermediate steps will be graded, as well as your ability to present a complete solution.  Moreover, your write-ups should be neatly written and make proper use of mathematical notation.  The problems for your Weekly Homework assignments will cover a subset of material covered the previous week.  This will provide you with an opportunity to reflect on previous material and to deepen your understanding.  Sometimes the problems will be identical to problems that you have already done and sometimes they will be new.  Typically, the Weekly Homework assignments will be due at the beginning of class on Thursdays.  You can find the list of homework assignments <a href="homework.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  Each Weekly Homework assignment will be worth 10 points and your overall Weekly Homework grade will be worth 20% of your final grade.  <b>You are allowed to submit up to two Weekly Homework assignments up to 24 hours late if you ask for permission at least 12 hours prior of the due date.</b>  Also, two (possibly more) of your lowest Weekly Homework scores will be dropped.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework.  However, each student is expected to turn in his or her own work.  Lastly, students are allowed to modify their homework in light of discussions/presentations made in class; however, <b>you are required to use the felt-tip pens provided in class</b>.</p>

<p>You can find the list of homework assignments <a href="homework.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  I reserve the right to modify the homework assignments as I see necessary.</p>

<h3>Exams</h3>
<p>There will be 3 midterm exams, which are <i>tentatively</i> scheduled for the following Thursdays: <b>February 23</b>, <b>March 29</b>, and <b>April 26</b>.  Each exam will be worth 15% of your overall grade.  There will also be a <i>cumulative</i> final exam, which will be on <b>Thursday, May 17</b> at 11:00am–1:30PM (<i>Note:</i> I'm using our Thursday at 12:30–1:45PM time slot to determine when our final exam is).  The final exam is worth 20% of your overall grade.  Make-up exams will only be given under extreme circumstances, as judged by me.  In general, it will be best to communicate conflicts ahead of time.</p>

<h3>Basis for Evaluation</h3>
<p>Your final grade will be determined by the scores of your homework, exams, and final exam.</p>

<h3>Grade Determination</h3>
<p>Grades may be "massaged" at the end of the semester, but in general you should expect the grades to adhere to the standard letter-grade cutoffs.</p>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>

<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Regular attendance is expected and is vital to success in this course, but you will not explicitly be graded on attendance.  All students should be familiar with the university <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/undergraduate/files/2010/11/Class-Attendance-Policy-May-2008.pdf" target="_blank">attendance policy</a> which can be found on page 45 of the PSU Academic Catalog as well as the Academic Integrity and Fairness in Grading policies as written on pages 40-43 of the PSU Academic Catalog. The catalog may be viewed <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/academics/files/2011/07/2011-12AcademicCatalog.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3>About Calculators and Other Technology</h3>
<p>I am a huge fan of technology and believe that when it is used appropriately, it can greatly enhance one's learning experience.  However, when learning, technology should never replace one's own amazing cognitive abilities.  When we are discussing concepts in class or when you are doing homework, you should feel free to use whatever resources you feel will help you understand the concepts better.  So, feel free to use things like <a  href="http://www.sagemath.org/" target="_blank"> Sage</a>, <a href="http://wolframalpha.com" target="_blank">Wolfram|Alpha</a>, your graphing calculator, etc. when doing homework.    However, be warned that I am much more interested in the process by which you arrived at your answer than the answer itself.  An answer to a homework or exam question that is correct but lacks justification may be worth little to no points.  If you understand a concept, then barring a silly computational error, the correct answer comes along for the ride.  Yet, getting the correct answer does not imply that you understand anything!  You are <i>not</i> required to purchase a graphing calculator nor will you need them on any of the exams.  However, you will be allowed to use a graphing calculator on exams as long as the calculator does <i>not</i> include a computer algebra system (CAS).  If you decide to purchase a graphing calculator, I recommend the TI-83 Plus.  If you have questions about whether a particular calculator is appropriate or allowed, please ask.  I will <i>not</i> spend class time discussing how to use a graphing calculator.</p>

<h3>Getting Help</h3>
<p>There are many resources available to get help.  First, I recommend that you work on homework in groups as much as possible, and to come see me whenever necessary.  Also, you are strongly encouraged to ask questions in the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/webapp/courses/course/view.php?id=15986" target="_blank">course forum</a> on our Moodle page page, as I will post comments there for all to benefit from.  To effectively post to the course forum, you will need to learn the basics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>, the standard language for typesetting in the mathematics community.  See the <a href="../../latex.html">Quick LaTeX guide</a> for help with $\LaTeX$.  If you need additional help with $\LaTeX$, post a question in the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/webapp/courses/course/view.php?id=15986" target="_blank">course forum</a> on our Moodle page.</p>

<p>Also, you can always <script type="text/javascript">mailScramble2("dcernst","plymouth","contact me");</script>.</p>

<h3>Math Activity Center</h3>
<p>You can also visit the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/math/resources/center.html" target="_blank">Math Activity Center</a>, which is located in Hyde 351.  This student-run organization provides peer tutoring services for most 1000 and 2000 level math courses and some 3000 level courses.  Tutors are typically math majors interested in teaching math and practicing their instructional skills.  You can drop in anytime during open hours.</p>

<h3>Student Handbook</h3>
<p>The PSU Student Handbook addresses policies pertaining to students with disabilities, religious observation, honor code, general conduct, etc.  The Handbook can be found <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/stulife/handbook/handbook.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3>ACT for Growth</h3>
<p>All teacher education majors are subject to the Areas of Concern/Targets for Growth policy, which is located <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/education/act.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3>ADA Statement</h3>
<p>Plymouth State University is committed to providing students with documented disabilities equal access to all university programs and facilities. If you think you have a disability requiring accommodations, you should immediately contact the PASS Office in Lamson Library (535-2270) to determine whether you are eligible for such accommodations. Academic accommodations will only be considered for students who have registered with the PASS Office. If you have a Letter of Accommodation for this course from the PASS Office, please provide the instructor with that information privately so that you and the instructor can review those accommodations. I urge anyone having difficulty with the material to see me during office hours to get extra help.</p>

<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>When does the learning happen?  It might happen in class, but most likely it happens when you sit down to do your homework.  Most of you can follow what happens on the board in class, but the question is, can you do it on your own?  To learn best, you must struggle with mathematics on your own.  It is supposed to be difficult.  However, if you are struggling too much, then there are resources available for you.  I am always happy to help you.  If my office hours don't work for you, then we can probably find another time to meet.  You can also get help from each other.  Get a study buddy!  Help each other learn.  Go the <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/math/resources/center.html" target="_blank">Math Activity Center</a>.  It is your responsibility to be aware of how well you understand the material.  Don't wait until it is too late if you need help.<i> Ask questions!</i></p>
