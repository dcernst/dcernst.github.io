<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>Homework will usually be assigned every lecture day and will usually be due at the beginning of the next lecture day. The due date for each assignment will be listed, so there should never be any confusion. Your homework will always be graded for completion and usually some portion of your work will be graded for correctness. You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. However, each student is expected to turn in their own work. Each assignment will be worth 5-10 points depending on the level of difficulty and/or amount of time required to complete an assignment (generally, more time consuming homework will be worth more). There will be approximately 20-25 homework assignments. Three (possibly more) of your lowest homework scores will be dropped. You are allowed to turn in up to three homework assignments late with no questions asked. Unless you have made arrangements in advance with me, homework turned in after class will be considered late. Occasionally, you may be required to submit your homework via Moodle or Sage. Your overall homework grade will be worth 25% of your final grade.</p>

<p>Here is the collection of assignments for the semester. This list will be updated as we progress through the course.  I reserve the right to modify the homework assignments as I see necessary.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Homework 1:</b> Send me an email at <script type="text/javascript">mailScramble("dcernst","plymouth");</script> and tell me something interesting about yourself. For example, something interesting about me is that in the summer of 2003, I was struck by lightning while doing a technical ridge traverse in the Indian Peaks Wilderness in Colorado. The purpose of this assignment is to: (1) make sure you have my email address, and (2) make sure you know that I want you to feel free comfortable contacting me.  (Due Tuesday, September 6 by 5PM)</li>
<li><b>Homework 2:</b> Stop by my office (Hyde 356) and say hello. If I'm not there, leave a note under the door.  The purpose of this assignment is to: (1) make sure you know where my office is, and (2) make sure you know that I want you to feel free comfortable stopping by to get assistance with this course or any other for that matter.  (Due Friday, September 9)</li>
<li><b>Homework 3:</b> Formalize the "Traffic Jam" problem that we encountered in class. That is, try to come up with precise language and notation for describing the rules of the game, the objective, and the solution. Feel free to invent your own definitions and notation, but be as explicit as possible. A short description isn't necessarily the goal.  This assignment is intentionally vague and it may be frustrating to not understand exactly what it is I'm looking for.  Do the best you can.  (Due Tuesday, September 6)</li>
<li><b>Homework 4:</b> Type a one-page response to the following questions.  (Due Thursday, September 8)
<ol>
<li>What is mathematics?</li>
<li>Is mathematics invented or discovered?  Why?</li>
<li>Should everyone study mathematics?  Why?  How much?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Homework 5:</b> Using the axiomatic system for Traffic Jam developed in class, for each statement below either prove the statement or explain why the statement cannot be proven.  (Due Thursday, September 15)
<ol>
<li>$\bullet~\circ~\bullet~\circ~\underline{\ \ }~\circ~\bullet~\circ~\bullet$</li>
<li>$\bullet~\circ~\bullet~\circ~\underline{\ \ }~\bullet~\circ~\bullet~\circ$</li>
</ol>
Also, find 2 more statements in Traffic Jam that you can prove and two more that you can't.</li>
<li><b>Homework 6:</b> Finish proving the theorems on the <a href="2000CircleDot.pdf" target="_blank">Circle-Dot Handout</a>.  (Due Tuesday, September 20)</li>
<li><b>Homework 7:</b> Imagine you have 25 pebbles, each occupying one square on a 5 by 5 chess board.  Tackle each of the following variations of a puzzle.  (Due Thursday, September 22)
<ol>
<li><b>Variation 1:</b> Suppose that each pebble must move to an adjacent square by only moving up, down, left, or right.  If this is possible, describe a solution.  If this is impossible, explain why.</li>
<li><b>Variation 2:</b> Suppose that all but one pebble (your choice which one) must move to an adjacent square by only moving up, down, left, or right.  If this is possible, describe a solution.  If this is impossible, explain why.</li>
<li><b>Variation 3:</b> Consider Variation 1 again, but this time also allow diagonal moves to adjacent squares.  If this is possible, describe a solution.  If this is impossible, explain why.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Homework 8:</b> Consider the following problem.  An overfull prison has decided to terminate some prisoners.  The jailer comes up with a game for selecting who gets terminated.  Here is his scheme.  10 prisoners are to be lined up all facing the same direction.  On the back of each prisoner's head, the jailer places either a black or a red dot.  Each prisoner can only see the color of the dot for all of the prisoners in front of them and the prisoners do not know how many of each color there are.  The jailer may use all black dots, or perhaps he uses 3 red and 7 black, but the prisoners do not know.  The jailer tells the prisoners that if a prisoner can guess the color of the dot on the back of their head, they will live, but if they guess incorrectly, they will be terminated.  The jailer will call on them in order starting at the back of the line.  Before lining up the prisoners and placing the dots, the jailer allows the prisoners 5 minutes to come up with a plan that will maximize their survival.  What plan can the prisoners devise that will maximize the number of prisoners that survive?  Some more info: each prisoner can hear the answer of the prisoner behind them and they will know whether the prisoner behind them has lived or died. Also, each prisoner can only respond with the word "black'' or "red.''  (Due Tuesday, September 27)</li>
<li><b>Homework 9:</b> Complete problems 27, 28, 29 from the set of calendar problems that Dr. Donovan handed out.  You can find a copy of the calendar problems <a href="CalendarProblems.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  (Due Thursday, September 29)</li>
