I was fortunate to spend all of last week at the [Institute of Computational and Experimental Mathematics](https://icerm.brown.edu) (ICERM) in Providence, RI working on a project in combinatorial game theory. I had a blast hanging out with the team, which consisted of Bret Benesh, Marie Meyer, Sarah Salmon, and Nandor Sieben. We did mathematics for 12+ hours per day and consumed copious amounts of coffee. Iâ€™m pretty sure we produced enough content for two publications and have lots of ideas for future work.
