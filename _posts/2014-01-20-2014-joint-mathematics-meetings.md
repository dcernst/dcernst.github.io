<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014/01/IMG_3817.jpg" align="left" width="100" img style="margin-right: 15px" />The [Joint Mathematics Meetings](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm) took place last week in Baltimore, MD. The JMM is a joint venture between the [American Mathematical Society](http://www.ams.org/home/page) and the [Mathematical Association of America](http://www.maa.org/). Held each January, the JMM is the largest annual mathematics meeting in the world. Attendance in 2013 was an incredible 6600. I don't know what the numbers were this year, but my impression was that attendance was down from last year.

As usual, the JMM was a whirlwind of talks, meetings, and socializing with my math family. My original plan was to keep my commitments to a minimum as I've been feeling stretched a bit thin lately. After turning down a few invitations to give talks, I agreed to speak as part of panel during a [Project NExT](http://www.maa.org/programs/faculty-and-departments/project-next) session. The title of the panel was "Tried & True Practices for IBL & Active Learning". Here, IBL is referring to [inquiry-based learning](http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html). Last year I gave several talks and co-organized workshops about IBL, so I knew preparing for the panel wouldn't be a huge burden.

The other speakers on the panel were [Angie Hodge](http://www.unomaha.edu/math/people/hodge/) (University of Nebraska, Omaha) and [Anna Davis](http://www.ohiodominican.edu/templates/academics-faculty.aspx?id=19327353083) (Ohio Dominican University). Each of us were given 15 minutes to discuss our approach to IBL and active learning and then we had about 20 minutes for questions. For my portion, I summarized my implementation of IBL in my proof-based courses followed by an overview of my IBL-lite version of calculus. Angie discussed in detail the way in which UNO is successfully adopting IBL in some of their calculus sections. Anna spent some time telling us about an exciting project called the [One-Room Schoolhouse](http://www.one-room-schoolhouse.com/), which attempts to solve the following problem: Small colleges and universities often struggle to offer a variety of upper-level courses due to low enrollment. According to the ORS webpage, the ORS setting allows schools to offer low-enrollment courses every semester at no additional cost to the institution. ORS is made possible by flipping the classroom.

I'm really glad that I took the time to speak on the panel. The audience asked some great questions and I had several fantastic follow-up conversations with people the rest of the week.

As a side note, one thing I was reminded of is that speaking early during the conference (which is when the panel occurred) is much better than speaking later. The past couple JMMs, I spoke on the last day or two, and in this case, my talk is always taking up bandwidth in the days leading up to it. It's nice to just get it out of the way and then be able to concentrate on enjoying the conference.

One highlight of the conference was having a pair of my current [undergraduate research students]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholarship/undergraduate-research/) (Michael Hastings and Sarah Salmon) present a poster during the [Undergraduate Student Poster Session](http://www.maa.org/programs/students/undergraduate-research/jmm-poster-session). Michael and Sarah have been working on an original research project involving diagrammatic representations of [Temperley-Lieb algebras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperley%E2%80%93Lieb_algebra). I've been extremely impressed with the progress that they have made and it was nice to be able to see them show off their current results. The title of their poster was "A factorization of Temperley-Lieb diagrams" (although this was printed incorrectly in the program). Here is their abstract:

> The Temperley-Lieb Algebra, invented by Temperley and Lieb in 1971, is a finite dimensional associative algebra that arose in the context of statistical mechanics. Later in 1971, R. Penrose showed that this algebra can be realized in terms of certain diagrams. Then in 1987, V. Jones showed that the Temperley&#8211;Lieb Algebra occurs naturally as a quotient of the Hecke algebra arising from a Coxeter group of type $A$ (whose underlying group is the symmetric group). This realization of the Temperley-Lieb Algebra as a Hecke algebra quotient was generalized to the case of an arbitrary Coxeter group. In the cases when diagrammatic representations are known to exist, it turns out that every diagram can be written as a product of "simple diagrams." These factorizations correspond precisely to factorizations in the underlying group. Given a diagrammatic representation and a reduced factorization of a group element, it is easy to construct the corresponding diagram. However, given a diagram, it is generally difficult to reconstruct the factorization of the corresponding group element. In cases that include Temperley&#8211;Lieb algebras of types $A$ and $B$, we have devised an efficient algorithm for obtaining a reduced factorization for a given diagram.

Perhaps I'm biased, but I think their poster looks pretty darn good, too.

All in all, I would say that I had a successful JMM. I had a lot more meetings than I've had in the past, so I missed out on several talks I really would have liked to attend. There's always next year.
