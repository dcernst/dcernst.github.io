Prior to this summer's [MathFest](http://www.maa.org/meetings/mathfest) in Portland, I was a co-facilitator for a four-day [workshop on inquiry-based learning](http://iblworkshop.org/home.html). My co-facilitators were [Stan Yoshinobu](http://www.stanyoshinobu.com) (Cal Poly, SLO), [Matt Jones](http://www.csudh.edu/math/mjones/) (CSU Dominguez Hills), and [Angie Hodge](http://www.unomaha.edu/math/people/hodge/) (University of Nebraska at Omaha). I love being a part of these workshops. Even though I'm there to help others get started on implementing IBL, I benefit tremendously from the experience and always leave feeling energized and fired up to teach. If you are an aspiring practitioner or a newish user of IBL, I highly encourage you to look into attending a future [IBL Workshop](http://iblworkshop.org/home.html), which is run as an [MAA PREP workshop](http://www.maa.org/programs/faculty-and-departments/prep-workshops).

On day three of the workshop, I gave a 30-minute plenary talk. Most of the sessions are designed to be highly interactive and this was one of the few times that we "talked at" the participants. At the end of day two, I had given the participants a choice of topics for the plenary and the request was to describe the general overview of my approach to IBL in proof-based classes versus a class like calculus. So, that's what I set out to do. The slides I used for my talk can be found below.

I'd like to think that my talk was more than the content of the slides, however, the slides ought be useful on their own for someone that is curious [about IBL](http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html). This talk was similar to others about IBL that [I've given in the past](http://danaernst.com/?s=inquiry-based+learning+talk).
