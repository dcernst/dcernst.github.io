In January 2023, I attended the [Combinatorial Game Theory Colloquia](http://cgtc.eu), which was held in S. Miguel, Azores.  What an awesome experience!  The conference is held every other year and I'll definitely be back.  On the final day of the conference, I gave a talk titled *Impartial geodetic convexity achievement and avoidance games on graphs*.  My talk summarized some of the work that was begun during my [week at ICERM]({{ site.baseurl }}/ICERM/) with Bret Benesh, Marie Meyer, Sarah Salmon, and Nandor Sieben.  Nandor was also at the conference and gave a talk.  Here is the abstract for my talk:

> A set $P$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is convex if it contains all vertices along shortest paths between vertices in $P$. The convex hull of $P$ is the smallest convex set containing $P$. We say that a subset of vertices $P$ generates the graph $G$ if the convex hull of $P$ is the entire vertex set.  We study two impartial games Generate and Do Not Generate in which two players alternately take turns selecting previously-unselected vertices of a finite graph $G$. The first player who builds a generating set for the graph from the jointly-selected elements wins the achievement game GEN($G$). The first player who cannot select a vertex without building a generating set loses the avoidance game DNG($G$). Similar games have been considered by several authors, including Harary et al. In this talk, we determine the nim-number for several graph families, including trees, cycle graphs, complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and hypercube graphs.

And here are the slides:

One result of the conference is that Nandor and I are now working on a new research project with Bojan Bašić, Paul Ellis, and Danijela Popović.  The project was inspired by Danijela's talk at the conference.  I'm really excited about this new project!
