This morning I stumbled on a tab I had open on my web browser for ages for a [Ted Talk about productive failure by Manu Kapur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlwkerwaV2E).  [Manu Kapur](https://www.manukapur.com) is a leading expert in productive failure. In Manu's Ted Talk, these two quotes struck me:

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>If you don't learn to fail, you will fail to learn.</p>
