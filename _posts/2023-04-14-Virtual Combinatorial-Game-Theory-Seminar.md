Well yesterday was a first. As I was standing in line at [Macy's Coffeehouse](https://www.macyscoffee.net) waiting for to order some coffee, I was pondering changes I was going to make to my slides for the afternoon's talk in the [Virtual Combinatorial Game Theory Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/virtual-cgt/seminar). My slides were basically done.  I just needed to draw some figures and tweak a few things.  It was 9am and my talk wasn't until 3pm, so plenty of time....and then I got a message from organizer [Svenja Huntemann](https://sites.google.com/concordia.ab.ca/svenjahuntemann/home) asking if I was almost there. Wait, what?  Isn't my talk at 3pm???  No, it turns out my talk was scheduled for 9am.  You might be wondering how this happened.  Well, the talk was scheduled for 12pm EDT.  I'll let y'all figure out what arithmetic error I made.

I jumped out of line at the coffee shop and started booking it to my office.  I hopped on Zoom 10+ minutes late and kicked off my talk using slides that I hadn't looked over and weren't complete. I think it wasn't a total disaster;)

The title of my talk was *Morphisms of impartial combinatorial games* and here is the abstract:

> The aim of this talk is to formalize some folklore from combinatorial game theory and to introduce a few new results concerning morphisms of impartial games, one of which we can think of as the First Isomorphism Theorem for impartial games. This is preliminary work that was initiated at the most recent Combinatorial Game Theory Colloquium in the Azores. This is joint work with Bojan Bašić, Paul Ellis, Danijela Popović, and Nándor Sieben.

And here are the slides:
