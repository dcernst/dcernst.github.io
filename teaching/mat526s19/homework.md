## Guidelines ##
On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) homework number. You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in their own work. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed to turn in **up to three late homework assignments with no questions asked**. Unless you have made arrangements in advance with me, homework turned in after class will be considered late. When doing your homework, I encourage you to consult the [Elements of Style for Proofs]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/ElementsOfStyle.pdf).

## Daily Homework ##
The following assignments are due at the beginning of the indicated class meeting. However, most assignments will be collected at the end of the class meeting.  I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations.  Daily assignments will be graded on a $\checkmark$-system.  During class, **you are only allowed and encouraged to annotate your homework using the colored marker pens that I provide**.

- **Daily Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat526s19/syllabus/) and write down 5 important items.  *Note:*  All of the exam dates only count as a single item.  Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class. (Due Wednesday, January 16)
- **Daily Homework 2:** If you haven't already, read the Preface (3 pages) and Chapter 0: Introduction to this book (14 pages) in *Inquiry Based Enumerative Combinatorics*. Jot down some notes and be prepared to explain/justify (1) the recurrence relation, (2) the closed form, and (3) the structural recurrence diagram for the $n$-disk version of the Towers of Hanoi.

- **Daily Homework 30:** Prove that $L_{n,k}(q)=\sum_{w\in S_n, \text{Des}(w)\subseteq \\{k\\}}q^{\text{inv}(w)}$ using a bijection between $L(k,n-k)$ and $\\{w\in S_n\mid \text{Des}(w)\subseteq \\{k\\}\\}$. (Due Wednesday, April 24)
- **Daily Homework 31:** Define the $q$-multinomial via
\\[\begin{bmatrix}n\\\ a_1,\ldots, a_k\end{bmatrix}=\frac{[n]!}{[a_1]!\cdots [a_k]!}.\\]
Prove that for any $J=\\{j_1,\ldots,j_{k-1}\\}\subseteq \\{1,\ldots,n-1\\}$, the distribution of inversions for all $w\in S_n$ with descent set contained in $J$ is given by the $q$-multinomial coefficient.  That is,
\\[\sum_{w\in S_n, \text{Des}(w)\subseteq J}q^{\text{inv}(w)}=\begin{bmatrix}n\\\ a_1,\ldots, a_k\end{bmatrix},\\]
where $a_1=j_1, a_k=n-j_{k-1}$, and $a_i=j_i-j_{i-1}$ for all $1<i<k$. (Due Friday, April 26)

    1. Prove that for any $n\geq k\geq 0$, we have
    \\[\sum_{p\in L(k,n-k)}q^{\text{maj}(p)}=\begin{bmatrix}n\\\ k\end{bmatrix}.\\]
    2. Let $P$ be the labeled poset consisting of the disjoint union of the chains $1<_P 2 <_P \cdots <_P k$ and $k+1 <_P k+2 <_P \ldots <_P n$ for some $k$. A *linear extension* of $P$ is a permutation in $S_n$ whose ordering respects the ordering of $P$.  Characterize the set of linear extensions of $P$.  *Hint:* For a linear extension $w$, consider $\text{Des}(w^{-1})$.
- **Daily Homework 33:** Define a *shuffle* of two words $u=u(1)u(2)\cdots u(k)$ and $v=v(1)v(2)\cdots v(l)$ to be the word containing the letters of $u$ and $v$ such that $u$ and $v$ appear as subwords in the proper order, and denote the set of shuffles of $u$ and $v$ by $\text{Shuff}(u,v)$. In the language of posets, the shuffles of $u$ and $v$ are the linear extensions of the disjoint union of $u$ and $v$. Prove that the $q$-binomial coefficient counts shuffles according to major index.  That is, we have
\\[\sum_{w\in \text{Shuff}(u,v)}q^{\text{maj}(w)}=\begin{bmatrix}n\\\ k\end{bmatrix}\\]
where $u=12\cdots k$ and $v=(k+1)\cdots n$. (Due Wednesday, May 1)

## Using LaTeX for Weekly Homework ##
You are required to use LaTeX to type up your Weekly Homework assignments. The easiest way to get started with LaTeX is to use an online editor.  I recommend using [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com), but there are other options.  The good folks over at Overleaf have preloaded my homework template, so to get started, all you need to do is click the link below and then click on "Open as Template". Be sure to update your name and the course title.
