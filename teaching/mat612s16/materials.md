## Free Abstract Algebra Textbooks ##
Here is a list of free abstract algebra texts that you may use as an additional resource.  If you find one of these more helpful than another, please let me know.  Also, if you know of other resources, please let me know.

* [An Inquiry-Based Approach to Abstract Algebra](http://dcernst.github.io/IBL-AbstractAlgebra/) is a set of IBL course materials that I wrote for an abstract algebra course that emphasizes visualization and incorporates technology.
* [Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications](http://abstract.ups.edu/index.html) by [Tom Judson](http://faculty.sfasu.edu/judsontw/) (Stephen F. Austin University).
* [Elementary Abstract Algebra: Examples and Applications](https://www.tamuct.edu/departments/math/textbook.php) by Justin Hill (Temple College) and Chris Thron (Texas A\&M University-Central Texas) with contributions from others.  The text is designed for students who are planning to become secondary-school teachers. The authors particularly emphasize material that has relevance to high school math, as well as practical applications. Much of the content is derived from the Judson book mentioned above.
* [Essential Group Theory](http://bookboon.com/en/textbooks/mathematics/essential-group-theory) by [Michael Batty](http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/michael-batty/) (University of Durham).
* [Group Theory: Birdtracks, Lie’s, and Exceptional Groups](http://www.cns.gatech.edu/GroupTheory/index.html) by [Predrag Cvitanović](https://www.physics.gatech.edu/user/predrag-cvitanovic) (Georgia Tech).
