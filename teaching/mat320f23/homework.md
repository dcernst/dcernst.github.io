## Guidelines ##
On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) homework number. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed to turn in **up to three late homework assignments**. Unless you have made arrangements in advance with me, homework turned in after class will be considered late. When doing your homework, I encourage you to consult the I encourage you to consult the "Elements of Style for Proofs" appendix in the textbook.

Reviewing material from previous courses and looking up definitions and theorems you may have forgotten is fair game. Since mathematical reasoning, problem solving, and critical thinking skills are part of the learning outcomes of this course, all assignments should be prepared by the student. Developing strong competencies in this area will prepare you to be a lifelong learner and give you an edge in a competitive workplace. When it comes to completing assignments for this course, unless explicitly told otherwise, you should *not* look to resources outside the context of this course for help.  That is, you should not be consulting the web (e.g., Chegg and Course Hero), generative artificial intelligence tools (e.g., ChatGPT), mathematics assistive technologies (e.g., Wolfram Alpha and Photomath), other texts, other faculty, or students outside of our course in an attempt to find solutions to the problems you are assigned.  On the other hand, you may use each other, the textbook, me, and your own intuition. You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in their own work.  **If you feel you need additional resources or support, please come talk to me and we will come up with an appropriate plan of action.**

## Daily Homework ##
The following assignments are due at the beginning of the indicated class meeting. However, most assignments will be collected at the end of the class meeting.  I reserve the right to modify an assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations.  During class, you are encouraged to annotate your homework, but **you are required to use a different color than what you used to complete your homework**.

- **Daily Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320f23/syllabus/) and write down 5 important items.  *Note:*  All of the exam dates only count as a single item.  Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class or email me a copy of your write up prior to class. (Due Wednesday, August 30)
- **Daily Homework 2:** Read the "Preface" and "Chapter 1: Introduction" in the textbook. In addition, complete 2.2-2.4 in "Chapter 2: Mathematics and Logic" and digest the surrounding text along the way. (Due Wednesday, August 30)

## Weekly Homework ##
For most of the assignments below, you will be required to submit 2-3 formally written proofs. You are required to type your submission using LaTeX (see below). 

<!-- You can either submit a hardcopy of your assignment or email me the PDF of your completed work. If you email me the PDF, please name your file as <code>WeeklyX-LastName.pdf</code>, where <code>X</code> is the number of the assignment and <code>LastName</code> is your last name.  Notice there are no spaces in the filename. -->

<!-- Submit your the PDF to the corresponding assignment on BbLearn. -->

- **Weekly Homework 1:** Watch "Grit: the power of passion and perseverance" and any other 4 videos listed under <em>Videos on Growth Mindset and Productive Failure</em> on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320f23/materials/">Course Materials</a> page and then write a reflection that is at least 15 sentences long. You should list the videos you watched. Rather than reflecting on each video separately, try to reflect on growth mindset, productive failure, and grit, in general. <b>You are required to type your reflection using LaTeX</b>. For this assignment, I suggest you use the template on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/weekly-homework-1-for-reflection-on-growth-mindset-and-productive-failure-foundations-of-mathematics/pxwcxqqrqmdv) (after clicking link, click on "Open as Template") instead of using the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below.  (Due ??? by 8PM)

## Using LaTeX for Weekly Homework ##
You are required to use LaTeX to type up your Weekly Homework assignments. The easiest way to get started with LaTeX is to use an online editor.  I recommend using [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com), but there are other options.  The good folks over at Overleaf have preloaded my homework template, so to get started, all you need to do is click the link below and then click on "Open as Template". Be sure to update your name and the course title.
