## Guidelines ##
On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) homework number. You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in his or her own work. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed to turn in **up to three late homework assignments with no questions asked**. Unless you have made arrangements in advance with me, homework turned in after class will be considered late. When doing your homework, I encourage you to consult the [Elements of Style for Proofs]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/ElementsOfStyle.pdf).

## Daily Homework ##
The following assignments are due at the beginning of the indicated class meeting. However, most assignments will be collected at the end of the class meeting.  I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations.  Daily assignments will be graded on a $\checkmark$-system.  During class, **you are only allowed and encouraged to annotate your homework using the colored marker pens that I provide**.

- **Daily Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320s20/syllabus/) and write down 5 important items.  *Note:*  All of the exam dates only count as a single item.  Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class. (Due Wednesday, January 15)

## Weekly Homework ##
For most of the assignments below, you will be required to submit 2-3 formally written proofs. You are required to type your submission using LaTeX (see below).  You can either submit a hardcopy of your assignment or email me the PDF of your completed work. If you email me the PDF, please name your file as <code>WeeklyX-LastName.pdf</code>, where <code>X</code> is the number of the assignment and <code>LastName</code> is your last name.  Notice there are no spaces in the filename.

- **Weekly Homework 1:** Watch "Grit: the power of passion and perseverance" and any other 4 videos listed under Growth Mindset and Productive Failure on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320s20/materials/">Course Materials</a> page and then write a reflection that is at least 15 sentences long. You should list the videos you watched. Rather than reflecting on each video separately, try to reflect on growth mindset, productive failure, and grit, in general. <b>You are required to type your reflection using LaTeX.</b>. For this assignment, I suggest you use the template on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/weekly-homework-1-for-reflection-on-growth-mindset-and-productive-failure-foundations-of-mathematics/pxwcxqqrqmdv) (after clicking link, click on "Open as Template") instead of using the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below.  (Due Friday, January 24 by 3PM)
- **Weekly Homework 2:** Prove **one** of 2.3, 2.4, 2.8, 2.14, 2.18, 2.22, 2.23. You must type up your proofs using LaTeX.  I suggest you use my Overleaf template, which you can access by clicking the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below. (Due Thursday, January 30 by 8PM)
- **Weekly Homework 3:** Prove **one** of 2.49-2.51. You must type up your proofs using LaTeX. In addition, read the Foreword, Preface, and any **two** stories (they aren't too long) from [Living Proof]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/LivingProof.pdf), and then type up responses to the following questions for each story.  Be sure to indicate which stories you read. Once again, use the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below. You'll need to delete one of the theorem/proof pairs to write your responses to the reflection questions. (Due Thursday, February 6 by 8PM)
    1. Did you identify with the author of the story? If so, in what way?
    2. How does the author's experience differ from your own?
    3. What surprised you about the author's story?
    4. Did this story make you think differently about mathematics? I'm expecting more than "yes/no".
    5. What about the story inspires and/or bothers you?
- **Weekly Homework 4:** Prove **two** of 2.49, 2.50, 2.61 (only need to prove in one way, your choice), 2.86. You must type up your proofs using LaTeX.  I suggest you use my Overleaf template, which you can access by clicking the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below. (Due Thursday, February 13 by 8PM)

## Using LaTeX for Weekly Homework ##
You are required to use LaTeX to type up your Weekly Homework assignments. The easiest way to get started with LaTeX is to use an online editor.  I recommend using [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com), but there are other options.  The good folks over at Overleaf have preloaded my homework template, so to get started, all you need to do is click the link below and then click on "Open as Template". Be sure to update your name and the course title.
