## An Introduction to Proof via Inquiry-Based Learning ##

This free and open-source textbook was written by me ([Dana C. Ernst](http://danaernst.com)) and is designed to be used with an [inquiry-based learning](http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html) (IBL) approach to an introduction to proof course. The source files are located on [GitHub](https://github.com/dcernst/IBL-IntroToProof).

I will not be covering every detail of the notes and the only way to achieve a sufficient understanding of the material is to be digesting the reading in a meaningful way.  You should be seeking clarification about the content of the notes whenever necessary by asking questions.  Here's one of my favorite quotes about reading mathematics.

<blockquote>
  <p>Donâ€™t just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?</p>
