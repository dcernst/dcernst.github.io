We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, January 13:</b> First day! The first few minutes of class were devoted to me attempting to learn names. I think I got them all! Next, I summarized what to expect from the course, toured the the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320s20/">course webpage</a>, and summarized a few items on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320s20/syllabus/">syllabus</a>. With the time we had left, we started discussing some of the content due on Wednesday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, January 15:</b> Unfortunately, I missed today due to being at a conference. Zach Parker covered for me while I was away. JJ, SS, FB, YF, AS, and ID presented Theorem 2.3, Theorem 2.4, Problem 2.5, Problem 2.7, Problem 2.8, and Problem 2.9, respectively.  That's a lot of student presentations!</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, January 17:</b> Zach covered for me again while I was gone.  IS, KB, NH, and JG presented Problem 2.12, Problem 2.13, Theorem 2.14, and Corollary 2.15, respectively. Next week, We will catch up on the ones that were not presented.</li>
</ul>

After some discussion of course expectations, we briefly discussed the use of LaTeX for the Weekly Homework assignments.  Next, we had CH and AL present Problem 2.16 and Theorem 2.17, respectively.  The proof of Theorem 2.17 generated lots of great discussion.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, January 24:</b> Awesome day!  We kicked off with presentations of Theorem 2.18 and Problem 2.19 by HG and JH.
