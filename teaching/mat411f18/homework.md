## Guidelines ##
On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) homework number. You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in his or her own work. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed to turn in **up to three late homework assignments with no questions asked**. Unless you have made arrangements in advance with me, homework turned in after class will be considered late. When doing your homework, I encourage you to use the Elements of Style for Proofs (see Appendix B of the [course notes]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411f18/materials/) as a reference.

## Daily Homework ##
The following assignments are due at the beginning of the indicated class meeting. However, most assignments will be collected at the end of the class meeting.  I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations.  Daily assignments will be graded on a $\checkmark$-system.  During class, **you are only allowed and encouraged to annotate your homework using the colored marker pens that I provide**.

- **Daily Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411f18/syllabus/) and write down 5 important items.  *Note:*  All of the exam dates only count as a single item.  Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class. (Due Wednesday, August 29)

## Weekly Homework ##
In addition to the Daily Homework, we will also have Weekly Homework assignments.  For most of these assignments, you will be required to submit 2-3 formally written proofs.  Typically, two of the problems will come directly from the Daily Homework from the previous week.  Any additional problems will likely be new.  You will be required to type your submission using LaTeX (see below for more on this).  You can either submit a hardcopy of your assignment or email me the PDF of your completed work. If you email me the PDF, please name your file as <code>WeeklyX-Lastname.pdf</code>, where <code>X</code> is the number of the assignment and <code>Lastname</code> is your last name.  Notice there are no spaces in the filename.

- **Weekly Homework 1:** On the [Course Materials]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411f18/materials/) page there is a list of videos about growth mindset and productive failure under "Miscellaneous Materials". Watch "Grit: the power of passion and perseverance" and any other 4 videos from the list and then write a reflection that is at least 15 sentences long. You should list the videos you watched. Rather than reflecting on each video separately, try to reflect on growth mindset, productive failure, and grit, in general. You are required to type your reflection in [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX).  For this assignment, I suggest you use the template on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/thkxsshhbgdf/clone) instead of using the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below. (Due Thursday, September 6 by 8PM)
- **Weekly Homework 2:** Prove **two** of Theorems 2.29, 2.37, 2.39. You must type up your proofs using LaTeX.  I suggest you use my Overleaf template, which you can access by clicking the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below. (Due Thursday, September 13 by 8PM)
- **Weekly Homework 3:** Prove **two** of Corollary 2.41, Theorem 2.42, Theorem 2.47, Theorem 2.50. You must type up your proofs using LaTeX.  I suggest you use my Overleaf template, which you can access by clicking the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below. (Due Tuesday, September 18 by 8PM)


<!-- - **Weekly Homework 3:** Prove **two** of Corollary 2.41, Theorem 2.42, Theorem 2.44, Theorem 2.45, Theorem 2.47(a), Theorem 2.47(b), Theorem 2.50, Theorem 2.63. You must type up your proofs using LaTeX.  (Due Thursday, February 8 by 8PM)
- **Weekly Homework 4:** Complete each of the following tasks. (Due Thursday, February 22 by 8PM)
  - Prove **one** of Theorems 3.19 and 3.21.
  - Determine whether each of the following statements is true or false. If a statement is true, write a short proof. If a statement is false, justify your reasoning. In each case, the context should make it clear what each letter represents. In particular, in Items 1, 3, and 5, $r$ represents rotation of a square by a quarter turn clockwise. But in Item 4, $r$ represents rotating a triangle by a third of a turn clockwise.
      1. $\\{s, r, sr, rs\\}\leq D_4$
      2. $\\{1, -1, i, -i, j, -j\\}\leq Q_8$
      3. $\\{e, sr, rs, r^2\\}\leq D_4$
      4. $\\{e, r, r^2\\} \leq D_3$
      5. $\\{e, r, r^2\\} \leq D_4$
- **Weekly Homework 5:** Prove **two** of Theorem 3.23, Theorem 3.24, Theorem 3.51, Theorem 3.52, Theorem 3.53, Theorem 3.54.  (Due Thursday, March 8 by 8PM)

- **Weekly Homework 7:** Prove **two** of Theorem 4.41, Theorem 4.44, Theorem 4.45, Problem 4.51, Problem 4.52.  (Due Thursday, April 5 by 8PM) -->

## Using LaTeX for Weekly Homework ##
You are required to use LaTeX to type up your Weekly Homework assignments.  To do this, I suggest that you use my [LaTeX Homework Template](https://github.com/dcernst/MiscTeachingMaterials/blob/master/HWTemplate/HWTemplate.tex).  The easiest way to get started with LaTeX is to use an online editor.  I recommend using [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com), but there are other options.  The good folks over at Overleaf have preloaded my template, so to get started, all you need to do is click the link below.
