## Instructions ##
You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in their own work. Unless you are explicitly told otherwise, when it comes to completing assignments for this course, you should *not* look to resources outside the context of this course for help.  That is, you should not be consulting the web, other texts, other faculty, or students outside of our course in an attempt to find solutions to the problems you are assigned.  This includes Chegg and Course Hero. **If you feel you need additional resources, please come talk to me and we will come up with an appropriate plan of action.** Please read NAU's [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www5.nau.edu/policies/Client/Details/828?whoIsLooking=Students&pertainsTo=All&sortDirection=Ascending&page=1).

## Required Assignments ##
In order to pass the course, you must complete each of the Required Assignments to a satisfactory level. If your work is deemed unsatisfactory, you will have one chance to resubmit your work.  We will negotiate a due date for any resubmissions.  In general, late Required Assignments will *not* be accepted.  However, you are allowed to turn in up to **two late Required Assignments** with no questions asked. I reserve the right to modify an assignment if the need arises.  

- **Homework 1:** Create a free [Discord](http://discord.com) account, accept the invite to our Discord server (see Welcome Message, which was sent to your NAU email), and post something about yourself in the #introductions channel. (Due Wednesday, August 31 by 9pm)
- **Homework 2:** Stop by my office (AMB 176) and say hello. If I'm not there, just slide a note under my door saying you stopped by. (Due Monday, September 12)
- **Homework 3:** Read the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat123f22/syllabus/) and write down 5 items that you think are important.  (Due Monday, September 12)
- **Homework 4:** Complete at least one Flexible Assignment from the list below. (Due Monday, September 12)
- **Homework 5:** Let's call this your "Math Autobiography" assignment. Address the following prompts. (Due Monday, September 19) <!--modified from Brian Katz -->
   - Story: Please write the story of your mathematical past. Through this story, you should communicate your reasons for being a mathematics/mathematics education/data science major (or major X) and your current feelings about mathematics as well as the events and experiences in your past that brought you here. You might consider including examples of positive and negative episodes from past math courses, moments in which math came up in other situations, and plans for the future.
   - Expertise: What skills do you bring with you to your mathematics courses? This response could include your skills with computational tools, like algebra, but it should go beyond mathematics. What other areas of academic expertise do you bring to class discussions? What co-academic skills and topics do you have at your finger-tips? In what areas are you currently building skills that you can connect with mathematics?
   - Support: Is there anything that you'd like me to know about you or your context that might make it harder for you to succeed and excel in this course and/or your other mathematics courses?
- **Homework 6:** Use software (your choice!) to create a flow chart that illustrates the prerequisite structure of all of the undergraduate mathematics courses offered by NAU that with course numbers greater than or equal to 123 and less than 500.  For each course, also include the following information: Course number (e.g., MAT 320), Title (e.g., Foundations of Mathematics), number of credits, and when a course is offered (e.g., every semester, fall only, springs of even years, etc.). Note: You do not need to include Honors courses nor MAT 199, MAT 299, MAT 399, MAT 499. (Due Monday, September 26)

<!-- - Watch “Grit: the power of passion and perseverance” and any other 4 videos listed under Videos on Growth Mindset and Productive Failure on the [Course Materials page]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat123f22/materials/) and then write a 1-2 page typed reflection. You should list the videos you watched. Rather than reflecting on each video separately, try to reflect on growth mindset, productive failure, and grit, in general. (100 points) -->

## Flexible Assignments ##
These assignments are a sort of "choose your own adventure".  Each Flexible Assignment has a designated point value.  Over the course of the semester, you must complete enough Flexible Assignments to **achieve at least 150 points by Friday, October 21** and a **total of at least 300 points by the end of semester**. Feel free to suggest more items for the list.

While this article makes some comments about the state of education and math students currently, I want you to focus and reflect on Andrew Wiles’ idea of what makes a good mathematician. Use the following questions/prompts below to guide you. (100 points)
    1. Pick 1-2 statements from this article that stuck out to you and briefly describe why they had an impact on you.

    7. How does mathematics and being stuck incorporate both the intellectual and the emotional?
    8. I sometimes describe math research as “How to deal with disappointment every day of your life.” How does this compare with Wiles’ ideas about math research?
