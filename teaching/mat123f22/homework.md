## Instructions ##
You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in their own work. Unless you are explicitly told otherwise, when it comes to completing assignments for this course, you should *not* look to resources outside the context of this course for help.  That is, you should not be consulting the web, other texts, other faculty, or students outside of our course in an attempt to find solutions to the problems you are assigned.  This includes Chegg and Course Hero. **If you feel you need additional resources, please come talk to me and we will come up with an appropriate plan of action.** Please read NAU's [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www5.nau.edu/policies/Client/Details/828?whoIsLooking=Students&pertainsTo=All&sortDirection=Ascending&page=1).

## Required Assignments ##
In order to pass the course, you must complete each of the Required Assignments to a satisfactory level. If your work is deemed unsatisfactory, you will have one chance to resubmit your work.  We will negotiate a due date for any resubmissions.  In general, late Required Assignments will *not* be accepted.  However, you are allowed to turn in up to **two late Required Assignments** with no questions asked. I reserve the right to modify an assignment if the need arises.  

- **Homework 1:** Create a free [Discord](http://discord.com) account, accept the invite to our Discord server (see Welcome Message, which was sent to your NAU email), and post something about yourself in the #introductions channel. (Due Wednesday, August 31 by 9pm)
- **Homework 2:** Stop by my office (AMB 176) and say hello. If I'm not there, just slide a note under my door saying you stopped by. (Due Monday, September 12)
- **Homework 3:** Read the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat123f22/syllabus/) and write down 5 items that you think are important.  (Due Monday, September 12 by classtime)
- **Homework 4:** Complete at least one Flexible Assignment from the list below. (Due Monday, September 12)
- **Homework 5:** Let's call this your "Math Autobiography" assignment. Address the following prompts. (Due Monday, September 19 by classtime) <!--modified from Brian Katz -->
   - Story: Please write the story of your mathematical past. Through this story, you should communicate your reasons for being a mathematics/mathematics education/data science major (or major X) and your current feelings about mathematics as well as the events and experiences in your past that brought you here. You might consider including examples of positive and negative episodes from past math courses, moments in which math came up in other situations, and plans for the future.
   - Expertise: What skills do you bring with you to your mathematics courses? This response could include your skills with computational tools, like algebra, but it should go beyond mathematics. What other areas of academic expertise do you bring to class discussions? What co-academic skills and topics do you have at your finger-tips? In what areas are you currently building skills that you can connect with mathematics?
   - Support: Is there anything that you'd like me to know about you or your context that might make it harder for you to succeed and excel in this course and/or your other mathematics courses?
- **Homework 6:** Use software (your choice!) to create a flow chart that illustrates the prerequisite structure of all of the undergraduate mathematics courses (both MAT and STA) offered by NAU with course numbers greater than or equal to 123 and less than 500.  For each course, also include the following information: Course number (e.g., MAT 320), Title (e.g., Foundations of Mathematics), number of credits, and when a course is offered (e.g., every semester, fall only, springs of even years, etc.). Note: You do not need to include Honors courses nor MAT 199, MAT 299, MAT 399, MAT 499. (Due Monday, September 26 by classtime)
- **Homework 7:** Create your individual degree progression plan for the mathematics, mathematics education, or data science degree.  Assume that you take cources every semester and graduate in 4 years (include this semester).  Your plan should more or less be a list of 8 semeters, where each semester lists the courses that you would take during a given semester.  Creating a table would be fine.  You only need to include required courses or courses you opt to take when there are choices.  You do not need to include your Liberal Studies courses. You should utilize your flow chart for prerequisites to help. Do not just blindly copy the degree progression plans that are posted on NAU's webpage as these make assumptions that may not hold true for you. (Due Monday, October 3 by classtime)
- **Homework 8:** Address the following prompts. Feel free to use the Internet to answer these questions (but mention your sources). (Due Monday, October 10 by classtime)
   - What is data science?
   - What is a data scientist and how does one become a data scientist?
   - What sorts of places employ data scientists?
   - What's an average or typical starting salary for a data scientist?
- **Homework 9:** Answer the following questions by scouring the Internet. (Due Monday, October 17 by classtime)
   - What are the duties of a university Provost?
   - Who is NAU's Provost?
   - How many colleges does NAU have?  List them.
   - Who is the Dean of the College of of the Environment, Forestry, and Natural Sciences (CEFNS)?
   - Who is the chair of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics?
   - How many of each of the following does the Department of Mathematics and Statistics have? (a) Instructor, (b) Lecturer or Senior Lecturer, (c) Assistant Teaching Professor, (d) Associate Teaching Professor, (e) (Full) Teaching Professor, (f) Assistant Professor, (g) Associate Professor, (h) (Full) Professor.
   - Which faculty members in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics are active in research and what are their research interests?  Also, list their title (e.g., Full Teaching Professor, Associate Professor, etc.).  You will likely stumble on an outdated list while researching this. Here are some updates: Blows and Burch have retired, Yildiz has resigned, and we've recently hired Samuel Harris, Michele Torielli, Benjamin Lucas, and Jaechoul Lee.  See if you can find the research interests of our new faculty members.
- There is no required homework assignment due on Monday, October 24.  Instead, you should focus on obtaining at least 150 points worth of Flexible Assignments by **by Friday, October 21**.
- **Homework 10:** Watch “Grit: the power of passion and perseverance” and any other 4 videos listed under Videos on Growth Mindset and Productive Failure on the [Course Materials page]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat123f22/materials/) and then write at least a 1-page typed reflection. You should list the videos you watched. Rather than reflecting on each video separately, try to reflect on growth mindset, productive failure, and grit, in general. At least a page!  Typed! Don't be a goofball with font size and margins. (Due Monday, October 31 by classtime)
- **Homework 11:** Generate a (rough) draft resume for the future you.  Assume you are about to graduate and apply for your first job. Tailor your resume to the type of job you think you might apply for.  You'll need to make some assumptions about the types of experiences and qualifications you will have in a few years.  Be hopeful and creative! You'll get a chance to revise in a couple weeks. (Due Monday, November 7 by classtime)
- **Homework 12:** Type at least one page that generally addresses the question "Is mathematics invented or discovered?" You should address the following items in your write up. If you end up looking anything up on the Internet about this question, please cite your sources. (Due Monday, November 14 by classtime)
   - What do you mean by the words "invented" vs "discovered"?
   - What do you mean by "mathematics"?  Or at least what are you considering to be "mathematics" for the purposes of this discussion?
   - Argue your point of view concerning whether mathematics in invented vs discovered.
- There is no required homework assignment due on Monday, November 21.  Instead, you should focus on getting close to at least 300 points worth of Flexible Assignments.
- **Homework 13:** Complete at least two course evaluations and submit documentation that you completed the evaluation.  When you complete each evaluation, you'll have the option to save a certificate (or possibly send to me directly). (Due Monday, November 28 by class time)
