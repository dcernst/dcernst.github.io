## Instructions ##
You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in their own work. Unless you are explicitly told otherwise, when it comes to completing assignments for this course, you should *not* look to resources outside the context of this course for help.  That is, you should not be consulting the web, other texts, other faculty, or students outside of our course in an attempt to find solutions to the problems you are assigned.  This includes Chegg and Course Hero. **If you feel you need additional resources, please come talk to me and we will come up with an appropriate plan of action.** Please read NAU's [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www5.nau.edu/policies/Client/Details/828?whoIsLooking=Students&pertainsTo=All&sortDirection=Ascending&page=1).

## Required Assignments ##
In order to pass the course, you must complete each of the Required Assignments to a satisfactory level. If your work is deemed unsatisfactory, you will have one chance to resubmit your work.  We will negotiate a due date for any resubmissions.  In general, late Required Assignments will *not* be accepted.  However, you are allowed to turn in up to **two late Required Assignments** with no questions asked. I reserve the right to modify an assignment if the need arises.  

- **Homework 1:** Create a free [Discord](http://discord.com) account, accept the invite to our Discord server (see Welcome Message, which was sent to your NAU email), and post something about yourself in the #introductions channel. (Due Wednesday, August 31 by 9pm)
- **Homework 2:** Read the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat123f22/syllabus/) and write down 5 items that you think are important.  (Due Monday, September 12)


## Flexible Assignments ##
These assignments are a sort of "choose your own adventure".  Each Flexible Assignment has a designated point value.  Over the course of the semester, you must complete enough Flexible Assignments to **achieve a total of ??? points**.  Feel free to suggest more items for the list.

- Coming soon.
