We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 12:</b> First Day!  We spent the majority of the time discussing logistics.  In particular, we did a brief overview of Zoom (chat, raise/lower hand, thumbs up, breakout rooms, polling) and toured the course webpage and BbLearn. We spent a few minutes discussing the purpose of the course and the framework for homework, but I'm leaving the rest of the syllabus for students to read on their own. With the time we had left, I split the class up into several small groups and each was tasked with discussing Problem 1. We had JC and NC present some of their thoughts in the final couple minutes.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 14:</b> Great first day of student presentations.  After discussing a few logistics items, I split the class up into several breakout rooms.  Each group was tasked with discussing/reviewing their solutions to Problems 2-4. After 10 or so minutes, we brought everyone back and launched into student presentations with me acting as scribe.  We had NB, CF, and MK present Problems 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Along the way, MW, JC, and AS suggested alternate approaches and chimed in with ideas.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 17:</b> Busy day!  We didn't quite get through everything, but we were productive nonetheless.  After a few quick announcements, I revisited Problem 4 (Sunny Day Juice Stand) and attempted to convince everyone that the amounts would be the same in each.  Next, we had MM, AR/NB, AS/KI, and MW present Problems 5(a), 5(b), 5(c), and 6, respectively.  We'll tackle Problems 7 and 8 next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 19:</b> Another good day.After a few announcements, I reviewed the strategies for Problems 5 and 6. Next, we had NC, BW/BT, and KB present Problems 7, 8, and 9, respectively, although we didn't quite finish Problem 9.  We'll pick up there next time and tackle Problem 10, as well.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 21:</b> Friday! We kicked off with KB wrapping up Problem 9 and then had AB and CB present Problems 10 and 11, respectively. We will catch up on Problem 12 next time.</li>
</ul>

## Week 3 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 24:</b> We got caught up and finished all the new stuff. Yay! We had ZW, CT, KC, and KF present Problems 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively (although, we didn't do them in that order). Lots of good discussion today, even though most of the class was kind of quiet.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 26:</b> After chatting about the quiz on Friday and the plan for next week, we had UA, CH, TH, JV, and SV present Problems 16, 17(a), 17(b), 17(c), and 18, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 28:</b> The students took Quiz 1.</li>
</ul>

## Week 4 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 31:</b> First day having a mix of face-to-face students and remote students.  I'd say it wasn't awful.  Wearing a mask for two hours straight is tough (but necessary!). We cranked through quite a bit today. We had SG, AR, JY, DZ, KB, ZW, and TH present Problems 19, 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), 20(d), and 21, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 2:</b> Some battling with technology today, but we managed okay.  After revisiting Problem 21 from last time, we had KF, AS, RR, KB, MK, CB, JC, and AR present Problems 22, 23(a), 23(b), 23(c), 24(b), 24(c), 24(d), and 24(a), respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 4:</b> We had UA, MW, CB, KI, MM, and NB present Problems 25, 26(a), 26(b), 26(c), 26(d), and 27, respectively.</li>
</ul>

## Week 5 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 7:</b> Labor Day. No classes!</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 9:</b> We kicked off with BT revisiting Problem 24(c), so that we could address something that I said last time that wasn't quite right.  Next, we had BW, JV, and CH present Problems 28, 29, and 30, respectively.  We had some technical issues during Problem 30, but I think it worked out okay. At the end, I revisited Problem 27 to make some useful observations about winning versus losing positions in combinatorial games.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 11:</b> The students took Quiz 2.</li>
</ul>
