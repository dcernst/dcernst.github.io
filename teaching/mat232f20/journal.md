We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 12:</b> First Day!  We spent the majority of the time discussing logistics.  In particular, we did a brief overview of Zoom (chat, raise/lower hand, thumbs up, breakout rooms, polling) and toured the course webpage and BbLearn. We spent a few minutes discussing the purpose of the course and the framework for homework, but I'm leaving the rest of the syllabus for students to read on their own. With the time we had left, I split the class up into several small groups and each was tasked with discussing Problem 1. We had JC and NC present some of their thoughts in the final couple minutes.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 14:</b> Great first day of student presentations.  After discussing a few logistics items, I split the class up into several breakout rooms.  Each group was tasked with discussing/reviewing their solutions to Problems 2-4. After 10 or so minutes, we brought everyone back and launched into student presentations with me acting as scribe.  We had NB, CF, and MK present Problems 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Along the way, MW, JC, and AS suggested alternate approaches and chimed in with ideas.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 17:</b> Busy day!  We didn't quite get through everything, but we were productive nonetheless.  After a few quick announcements, I revisited Problem 4 (Sunny Day Juice Stand) and attempted to convince everyone that the amounts would be the same in each.  Next, we had MM, AR/NB, AS/KI, and MW present Problems 5(a), 5(b), 5(c), and 6, respectively.  We'll tackle Problems 7 and 8 next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 19:</b> Another good day.After a few announcements, I reviewed the strategies for Problems 5 and 6. Next, we had NC, BW, and KB present Problems 7, 8, and 9, respectively, although we didn't quite finish Problem 9.  We'll pick up there next time and tackle Problem 10, as well.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 21:</b> Coming soon.</li>
</ul>
