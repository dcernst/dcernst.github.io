We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 23:</b> First Day!  After attempting to learn names, we spent some time discussing what the course is all about and how the course will be structured. We also took a quick tour of the course webpage.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 25:</b> After fielding some questions about course structure, I divided the class up into several small groups.  Each group discussed the problems they chose to review and then generated a list of problems and/or topics they felt they needed more review on. After collecting the list of potential review topics, we jumped in and started discussing a few of them. We'll continue doing this on Friday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 27:</b> We didn't cover much ground today, but I think it was productive nonetheless.  I presented partial proofs to Problems 2.23 and 2.47. This was intended to act as review.  Next, we had RP present Problem 3.2.  Lots of great discussion.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 30:</b> Week 2! I wrote down sketches of proofs for Problems 3.8(a), 3.8(b), 3.8(h), and 3.9 at the beginning of class.  Next, we had LS, FB, LK, PK, and LH present Problems 3.4, 3.8(c), 3.8(d), 3.8(e), and 3.8(g), respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 1:</b> Coming soon.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 3:</b> Coming soon.</li>
