We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 23:</b> First Day!  After attempting to learn names, we spent some time discussing what the course is all about and how the course will be structured. We also took a quick tour of the course webpage.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 25:</b> After fielding some questions about course structure, I divided the class up into several small groups.  Each group discussed the problems they chose to review and then generated a list of problems and/or topics they felt they needed more review on. After collecting the list of potential review topics, we jumped in and started discussing a few of them. We'll continue doing this on Friday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 27:</b> We didn't cover much ground today, but I think it was productive nonetheless.  I presented partial proofs to Problems 2.23 and 2.47. This was intended to act as review.  Next, we had RP present Problem 3.2.  Lots of great discussion.</li>
</ul>

  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 1:</b> We finally got caught up! We had GM, LH, BH, MH, and MW present Problems 3.8(g), 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, and 3.16, respectively.  Along the way, I presented Problems 3.8(h) and 3.9.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 3:</b> Another awesome day!  Super happy with how things are going.  We had KF, BR, TB, TW, and AR present Problems 3.18(forward implication), 3.18(reverse implication), 3.19, and 3.21, respectively.</li>
