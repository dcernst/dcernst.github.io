## Instructions ##
On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) homework number. You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in their own work. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed to turn in **up to three late homework assignments**. When doing your homework, I encourage you to consult the [Elements of Style for Proofs]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/ElementsOfStyle.pdf).

Reviewing material from previous courses and looking up definitions and theorems you may have forgotten is fair game. However, when it comes to completing assignments for this course, you should *not* look to resources outside the context of this course for help.  That is, you should not be consulting the web, other texts, other faculty, or students outside of our course in an attempt to find solutions to the problems you are assigned.  This includes Chegg and Course Hero. On the other hand, you may use each other, the textbook, me, and your own intuition. **If you feel you need additional resources, please come talk to me and we will come up with an appropriate plan of action.** Please read NAU's [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www5.nau.edu/policies/Client/Details/828?whoIsLooking=Students&pertainsTo=All&sortDirection=Ascending&page=1).

## Assignments ##
<!-- Unless otherwise indicated, submit each of the following assignments via BbLearn. I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations. -->
The following assignments are due at the beginning of the indicated class meeting. However, most assignments will be collected at the end of the class meeting.  I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations.  During class, you are encouraged to annotate your homework, but **you are required to use a different color than what you used to complete your homework**.

- **Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat431f21/syllabus/) and write down 5 important items. *Note:*  All of the exam dates only count as a single item.  Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class or email me a copy of your write up prior to class. (Due Wednesday, August 25)
- **Homework 2:** Create a free [Discord](http://discord.com) account, accept the invite to our Discord server (see welcome message in email), and post something about yourself in the #introductions channel. (Due Wednesday, August 25 by 8PM)
- **Homework 3:** Read the [Preface]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat431f21/Preface.pdf) and [Introduction]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat431f21/Introduction.pdf). The purpose of [Chapter 2: Preliminaries]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat431f21/Preliminaries.pdf) is to summarize most of the content from MAT 320 that we need to be familiar prior to starting something new. Read through this chapter and complete any 5 problems in Section 2.1, 1 problem in Section 2.2, and 5 problems in Section 2.3. I encourage you to try ones you aren't quite certain how to do in order to maximize your review. In addition, make a list of a few problems you are not sure how to complete. (Due Wednesday, August 25)
- **Homework 4:** Complete Problems 3.2-3.5 from [Chapter 3: The Real Numbers]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat431f21/RealNumbers.pdf). (Due Friday, August 27)
- **Homework 5:** Complete Problems 3.8, 3.9, 3.13, 3.14 from [Chapter 3: The Real Numbers]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat431f21/RealNumbers.pdf). (Due Monday, August 30)
- **Homework 6:** Complete Problems 3.15-3.17 from [Chapter 3: The Real Numbers]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat431f21/RealNumbers.pdf). (Due Wednesday, September 1)
