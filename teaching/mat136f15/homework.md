Unless a student has a documented excused absence, late homework will not be accepted.  There are many resources available to assist you with doing your homework (e.g., office hours, course Google Group, free tutoring at numerous places across campus). You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework.  However, each student is expected to turn in their own work.

You are strongly encouraged to ask questions in the [course Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mat-136-google-group-fall-2015), as I (and hopefully other members of the class) will post comments there for all to benefit from.  You are also encouraged to stop by during my office hours and you can always [email me](mailto:dana.ernst@nau.edu).  Lastly, *free* tutoring is available in AMB 137 through the [Math Achievement Program](http://nau.edu/student-learning-centers/).

## Daily Homework ##

The Daily Homework will generally consist of solving problems from the [IBL course notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf) (PDF).  On the day that a homework assignment is due, the majority of the class period will be devoted to students presenting some subset (maybe all) of the solutions/proofs that are due that day. Students are allowed (in fact, encouraged!) to modify their written solutions in light of presentations made in class; however, **you are required to use the colored marker pens provided in class**.

- **Daily Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/syllabus) and write down 5 important items.  *Note:*  All of the test dates only count as one item.  Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class. (Due Wednesday, 9/2)
- **Daily Homework 2:** Stop by my office (AMB 176) and say hello. If I'm not there, just slide note under my door saying you stopped by. (Due Friday, 9/4 by 5PM)
- **Daily Homework 3:** Read the Introduction and Chapter 0 up to Problem 11 of [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf) (PDF) and complete Problems 3-11.  In addition, skim through the Introduction and Chapter 1 of *Calculus I Lecture Notes*. (Due Wednesday, 9/2)

- **Daily Homework 5:** Read the rest of Chapter 0 in [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf) and complete Problems 12, 14, 15, 17-19. For Problem 14, feel free to use a graphing calculator or a computer to obtain the graph of the function. (Due Friday, 9/4)
- **Daily Homework 6:** Read Chapter 1 in [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf) up to Problem 32 and complete Problems 21-29, 31, 32. *Hint:* Problem 25 is hinting at tangent lines (see Definition 30). (Due Wednesday, 9/9)
- **Daily Homework 7:** Read the rest of Chapter 1 in [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf) up to Problem 41 and complete Problems 33-35, 37-41. *Hints:* For Problem 34, use Problem 26 and the idea from Problem 25. For Problem 35 use the same approach as Problem 34. For Problems 37 and 38, use Problems 33 and 34, respectively. (Due Friday, September 11)
- **Daily Homework 8:** Read the rest of Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 in [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf) up to Problem 51.  In addition, complete Problems 43-45, 47-51. *Note:* For Problems 47-51, feel free to utilize technology to graph the functions, but you should also attempt to explore the functions algebraically. (Due Monday, September 14)
- **Daily Homework 9:** Read Chapter 2 in [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf) up to Theorem 68.  In addition, complete Problems 52-54, 56-58, 66, 67. Also, read Theorem 68 and try to draw to picture that captures its meaning. *Note:* For Problems 52-54, feel free to utilize technology to graph the functions, but you should also attempt to explore the functions algebraically. *Hint:* For the third part of Problem 67, look up the formula for factoring a difference of two cubes. (Due Wednesday, September 16)
- **Daily Homework 10:**  Read the rest of Chapter 2.  In addition, complete Problems 69-75. For Problem 69, you should just look up the answer (e.g., use a Google search). *Hints:* For Problem 72, you cannot "pull the 4 out of the sine function".  However, a key observation is that $4\theta\to 0$ as $\theta\to 0$. For Problem 73, consider multiplying the expression by $4/4$.  For Problem 74, consider multiplying by the conjugate and using a relevant trig identity.  For Problem 75, use the Sandwich/Squeeze Theorem. (Due Friday, September 17)
- **Daily Homework 11:** Complete Exercises 2.4.16 and 2.4.17 in *Calculus I Lecture Notes*. (Due Monday, September 21)

In addition, complete Problems 78, 80, 81, 83-89. *Note:* For all five parts of Problem 81, you should use what you learned in Problems 78 and 80 instead of computing the derivative using Definition 76.  For Theorem 82, your job is to prove both parts using Definition 76.  For Theorem 87, your job is to prove the product rule. For Problem 88, rewrite $x^3$ as $x\cdot x^2$ and use your work on previous problems together with the Product Rule.  Similar hint for Problem 89. (Due Wednesday, September 30)
- **Daily Homework 14:** Read Chapter 3 up to Problem 93. In addition, complete Problems 90, 92, 93.  Also, complete the statement of Theorem 91. (Due Thursday, October 1)

Complete Problems 132-134, 136(a)(b), 139, 141, 142 in [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf).  Also, complete the statement of Theorems 135 and 140 along the way.  (Due Friday, October 2)
- **Daily Homework 16:** Complete Problems 121, 125-129, 136(c), 137, 138 in [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf).  *Hints:* To do 125 and 126, you will need Theorem 124.  Also, it may be useful to know in advance that $$\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)]=\cos(x)$$ and $$\frac{d}{dx}[\cos(x)]=-\sin(x).$$
To compute the derivatives of the functions for Problem 137, you should use the derivatives that I just mentioned and the quotient rule. (Due Monday, October 5)
- **Daily Homework 17:** Complete Problems 149-153 in [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf).  *Hints:* It will be useful to know that $$\frac{d}{dx}[e^x]=e^x$$ and $$\frac{d}{dx}[b^x]=b^x\ln(b).$$
You'll prove that the first formula is correct in Problem 150.  For now, you can just assume that the second formula is correct. (Due Wednesday, October 7)
- **Daily Homework 18:** Complete Problems 160, 163-166 in [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf).  *Hints:* It will be useful to know that for $x>0$ $$\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)]=\frac{1}{x}$$ and $$\frac{d}{dx}[\log_b(x)]=\frac{1}{x\ln(b)}.$$ Also, when the author writes $\overline{f}$, you should just write $f^{-1}$. (Due Thursday, October 8)
- **Daily Homework 19:** Read Section 3.10 in *Calculus I Lecture Notes*.  In addition, copy down the proof of Proposition 3.10.1 and make sure you understand it.  Notice that the proof is using the result of Problem 164 from [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf).  Then complete Exercises 3.10.2 and 3.10.3 in *Calculus I Lecture Notes*. *Hints:* For Problem 3.10.2, mimic the proof of Proposition  3.10.1. (Due Friday, October 9)
- **Daily Homework 20:** Complete Exercises 3.11.2 and 3.11.3 from *Calculus I Lecture Notes*. (Due Monday, October 12)

- **Daily Homework 22:** Complete Problems 167-170, 173, 175 in [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf).  *Hints:* The point of Problem 169 is to not just use the Power Rule because we are trying to understand why the Power Rule works for fractional exponents.  Instead rewrite $y=x^{4/3}$ as $y^3=x^4$ and use implicit differentiation.  Alternatively, you can try to use the log trick.  To prove Theorem 170, mimic what you did in Problem 169. The point of Problem 173 is to prove the derivative formula for $b^x$. To do this, use the log trick.  Prove Theorem 175 by using the log trick. (Due Wednesday, October 21)
- **Daily Homework 23:** Complete Problems 94, 97-100, 102-105 in [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf). Also, digest the relevant definitions nearby.  (Due Thursday, October 22)
