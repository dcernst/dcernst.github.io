## Course Notes & Other Resources ##
Below you will find notes and handouts that we have used in class, as well as some other useful stuff.

- [Introduction to WeBWorK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqv2dk70IFw). **Note:** There are some inconsistencies in this video due to the fact that I made it for my Fall 2012 class.  The version of WeBWorK has been upgraded, but it should still be useful.

## Free Calculus Textbooks ##
Here is a list of free calculus texts that you may use as an additional resource.  If you find one of these more helpful than another, please let me know.  Also, if you know of other resources, please let me know.

* [APEX Calculus](http://www.apexcalculus.com) is an open-source textbook by a group of faculty from Virginia Military Institute.  It has the look and feel of a traditional calculus (e.g., Stewart's *Calculus*). Includes interactive 3D graphics.
* [MOOCulus Textbook](https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts) is a free textbook from the [Ximera](https://ximera.osu.edu/) folks at Ohio State University. This text is mostly an adaptation of the Community Calculus text listed below.
* [Community Calculus](http://communitycalculus.org) by [David Guichard](http://skink.whitman.edu/~guichard/) (Whitman College). This one is also available as a free PDF. You can also purchase a very inexpensive hardcopy from [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/whitmancalculus).
* [Active Calculus](http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/Download.html) by [Matt Boelkins](http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/MB.html) (Grand Valley State College). This is one of the newer additions to the list of free calculus texts.
* [Calculus](http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/) by [Gilbert Strang](http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/) (MIT). This book is available as a free PDF from the [MIT Open Courseware Project](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm). There are also some corresponding videos, which can be found [here](http://ocw.mit.edu/high-school/courses/highlights-of-calculus/index.htm).
* [Calculus Refresher](http://www.math.umn.edu/~garrett/calculus/) by [Paul Garrett](http://www.math.umn.edu/~garrett/index.shtml) (University of Minnesota). Another free PDF. This short book seems designed for students who have had some experience with calculus and need some review.
* [Funny Little Calculus Text](http://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/FLCT/index.html) by [Robert Ghrist](http://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/index.html) (University of Pennsylvania). Currently only first semester calculus, very short, and no exercises, but a free PDF.
* [Paulâ€™s Online Math Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) by [Paul Dawkins](http://www.math.lamar.edu/faculty/dawkins/dawkins.aspx) (Lamar University). Paul's notes cover Calculus 1-3, Linear Algebra, and more. The notes are available as free HTML-based material. These notes seem to be popular with students.
* [Differential Calculus with Sage](http://wdjoyner.com/teach/calc1-sage/) by [David Joyner](http://wdjoyner.com/) (United States Naval Academy) and Granville. This free book is available as either a PDF or in HTML form. The book covers first semester calculus and incorporates [Sage](http://sagemath.org), which is an open-source mathematics software package.
* [Integral Calculus with Sage](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/teaching/calc2-sage/) by [Dale Hoffman](http://scidiv.bellevuecollege.edu/dh/) (Bellevue Community College), [William Stein](http://modular.math.washington.edu/) (University of Washington), and [David Joyner](http://wdjoyner.com/) (United States Naval Academy). The book picks up where the previous book left off.
* [Contemporary Calculus](http://scidiv.bellevuecollege.edu/dh/Calculus_all/Calculus_all.html) by [Dale Hoffman](http://scidiv.bellevuecollege.edu/dh/) (Bellevue Community College).  A free online calculus text that is being developed for the [Open Course Library Project of the Washington State Colleges](http://opencourselibrary.org).  This book is part of the foundation for the previous book.  It covers three semesters of calculus and seems to do a thorough job of it, but the formatting is awful.
