## Guidelines ##
Unless a student has a documented excused absence, late homework will not be accepted.  There are many resources available to assist you with doing your homework (e.g., office hours, Discord discussion group, free tutoring at numerous places across campus). You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework.  However, each student is expected to turn in his or her own work. You are strongly encouraged to ask questions in our Discord discussion group, as I (and hopefully other members of the class) will post comments there for all to benefit from.  You can also encouraged to stop by during my office hours and you can always [email me](mailto:dana.ernst@nau.edu).  Lastly, *free* tutoring is available through the [Math Achievement Program](https://in.nau.edu/academic-success-centers/math-achievement-program/).

## Daily Homework ##

## Weekly Homework ##
For each of the Weekly Homework assignments, answer each of the indicated questions. To receive full credit on a problem, you must show sufficient work for each of your answers (unless stated otherwise).  How you reach your answer is more important than the answer itself. I expect your solutions to be *well-written*, *neat*, and *organized*.  Do not turn in rough drafts.  What you turn in should be the polished version of potentially several drafts. You should submit your work to the corresponding assignment on BbLearn. Most students will likely use pencil and paper to complete their assignment. In this case, you should scan your work as single PDF document. There are many free applications available for doing this on your smartphone. I use TurboScan on my iPhone.

- **Weekly Homework 1:** Complete the problems posted [here]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat136f20/136Weekly1.pdf). You will need to capture your handwritten work digitally and then upload a single PDF document (possibly with multiple pages) to BbLearn (look in "Assignments Submitted via BbLearn" folder). There are many free smartphone apps for doing this. I use TurboScan on my iPhone. (Due Thursday, August 20 by 8pm)
- **Weekly Homework 2:** Complete the problems posted [here]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat136f20/136Weekly2.pdf). You will need to capture your handwritten work digitally and then upload a single PDF document (possibly with multiple pages) to BbLearn (look in "Assignments Submitted via BbLearn" folder).
