## Welcome ##
<!-- Welcome to the course web page for the Fall 2020 manifestation of MAT 136: Calculus I at [Northern Arizona University](http://nau.edu). This course is a first calculus course concentrating on limits, continuity, the derivative, and integration. Applications are made to classical problems in physics and other sciences. Calculus is one of the great achievements in human history, and I am happy that I get to share it with you. Detailed information about the course and its structure is available at the links above. -->

## Getting Help ##
There are many resources available to assist you with doing your homework (e.g., office hours, Discord discussion group, free tutoring at numerous places across campus). You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework.  However, each student is expected to turn in his or her own work. You are strongly encouraged to ask questions in our Discord discussion group, as I (and hopefully other members of the class) will post comments there for all to benefit from.  You can also encouraged to stop by during my office hours and you can always [email me](mailto:dana.ernst@nau.edu).  Lastly, *free* tutoring is available through the [Math Achievement Program](https://in.nau.edu/academic-success-centers/math-achievement-program/).
