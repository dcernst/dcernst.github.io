We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 12:</b> First Day!  We spent the majority of the time discussing logistics.  In particular, we did a brief overview of Zoom (chat, raise/lower hand, thumbs up, breakout rooms, polling) and toured the course webpage and BbLearn. We spent a few minutes discussing the framework for homework, but I'm leaving the rest of the syllabus for students to read on their own.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 14:</b> Awesome first day of presentations!  After reviewing a few logistics items, we jumped into student presentations (with me acting as scribe).  We had RP/SS, FB/RL, JA, HG, and KB/BJ present Problems 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5, respectively.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 17:</b> We got caught up on the leftovers from last time, but didn't have time to start the new ones.  we will try to get caught up next time.  After reviewing some key concepts, we jumped into student presentations with me usually acting as scribe. We had ZM, MJ, IS, SS, MC, and BJ present Problems 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, and 2.11, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 19:</b> Productive day!  We got caught up with some time to spare.  After a quick review of some key concepts, we had AA, JW, JB, AC, AS, and CH present Problems 2.12, 2.13(a), 2.13(b), 2.13(c), 2.14, and 2.18, respectively.  Along the way, I presented Problem 2.17.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 21:</b> Friday!  After some chit chat about the potential of classes staying remote vs NAUFlex, I quickly summarized Problem 2.19 and then we jumped into student presentations.  We had JK, AL, SS, MK2, and KG present Problems 2.20, 2.21, 2.23, 2.26(a), and 2.26(b), respectively.  Along the way, I discussed Problems 2.22 and 2.24.</li>
</ul>

## Week 3 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 24:</b> I'm happy with what we got through today.  We had MK/AC, MW, RP/MC, JA, RL, and IS present Problem 2.27, Problem 2.29, Theorem 2.29, Problem 2.31(a), Problem 2.31(b), and Problem 2.32, respectively. In the last few minutes, I reviewed the definition of group.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 26:</b> After briefly discussing the potential plan for next week, we had KB, FB, and BJ present Problem 2.34, Theorem 2.37, and Theorem 2.39, respectively.  Along the way, I presented Problems 2.35, 2.36, and 2.38.  We didn't quite finish Theorem 2.39, so we will start with that next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 28:</b> Maybe our best day yet! After BJ wrapped up Theorem 2.39, we had NC, JF, IV, EB/SS/IS, and AC present Problem 2.40, Theorem 2.41, Theorem 2.42, Theorem 2.43, and Theorem 2.44, respectively.</li>
</ul>

## Week 4 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 31:</b> First day having a mix of face-to-face students and remote students.  I'd say it wasn't awful.  Wearing a mask for two hours straight is tough (but necessary!). After I sketched the proofs of the three parts of Theorem 2.47, we had MJ, MK, and JB present Problem 2.48, Problem 2.49, and Theorem 2.52. Hopefully, we will get caught up or close to it next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 2:</b> I got thrown off my game with some technology issues before class started, but I think we managed just fine.  We had ZM, MW, JK, AL, AB, AA, EB, and NC present Problems 2.55, 2.56(abc), 2.56(d), 2.56(e), 2.57, 2.58(ab), 2.58(cd), and 2.58(e), respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 4:</b> We had CH, HG, AS, MJ, NC, KG, MC, SS, and JW present Problems 2.58(f), 2.59, 2.60, 2.61(a), 2.61(b), 2.61(c), 2.62, 2.63, and 2.64, respectively.</li>
</ul>

## Week 5 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 7:</b> Labor Day. No classes!</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 9:</b> We briefly discussed the upcoming exam and then reviewed Problem 2.64. Next, we had RP, JA, HG, JF, and FB present Theorem 2.65, Problem 2.66, Problem 2.67, Problem 2.68, and Problem 2.71, respectively.  Along the way, I presented Problem 2.69 and discussed some of the Cayley diagrams in Problem 2.72.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 11:</b> After a quick discussion of next week's exam, we had AC, MJ, and ZM present Problems 2.73, 2.78, and 2.79, respectively.  Along the way, I revisited Problem 2.72 and discussed Problem 2.74.</li>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 14:</b> We had AS and MW present Problems 2.80 and 2.81, respectively. I led discussions on Theorem 2.76, Theorem 2.77, Problem 2.82, Problem 3.1, Problem 3.2 and Problem 3.3. We will catch up on Problem 3.5 next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 16:</b> Super productive day.  We had BJ, MK, AL, AB, IV, and FB present Problem 3.5, Theorem 3.6, Theorem 3.7, Problem 3.8, Theorem 3.9, and Theorem 3.10, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 18:</b> Students took Part 1 of Exam 1.</li>
</ul>

## Week 7 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 21:</b> While the students are working on the take-home portion of Exam 1, I will lecture this week.  I discussed 3.11 through part of 3.16.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 23:</b> After answering questions about Part 2 of Exam 1, I continued lecturing over Chapter 3 material.  We got up to Problem 3.20.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 25:</b> More lecturing. We got up to definition of subgroup lattice.</li>
</ul>

## Week 8 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 28:</b> After a quick discussion of Theorem 3.24 and Problem 3.25, we had MJ, AS, KG, SS, KB, and CH present Theorem 3.26, Problem 3.27, Problem 3.28, Problem 3.29, Problem 3.30, and Problem 3.32, respectively.

  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 30:</b> We didn't get through everything, but it was still a productive day.  A few people passed on presentations today. Doing this a couple times is no big deal, but it'll have a negative impact if done repeatedly (see syllabus). We had RP, JB, ZM, MJ, and AS present Problems 3.33, 3.34, 3.35, 3.36 and 3.37, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, October 2:</b> First, we had MW, IV, MK, and AB present Problems 3.38, 3.39, 3.40, and 3.41, respectively.  Next, I outlined the proofs of Problems 3.42-3.44 and Theorem 3.45. We try to get caught up next class.</li>
</ul>
