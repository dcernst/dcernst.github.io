We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 12:</b> First Day!  We spent the majority of the time discussing logistics.  In particular, we did a brief overview of Zoom (chat, raise/lower hand, thumbs up, breakout rooms, polling) and toured the course webpage and BbLearn. We spent a few minutes discussing the framework for homework, but I'm leaving the rest of the syllabus for students to read on their own.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 14:</b> Awesome first day of presentations!  After reviewing a few logistics items, we jumped into student presentations (with me acting as scribe).  We had RP/SS, FB/RL, JA, HG, and KB/BJ present Problems 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5, respectively.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 17:</b> We got caught up on the leftovers from last time, but didn't have time to start the new ones.  we will try to get caught up next time.  After reviewing some key concepts, we jumped into student presentations with me usually acting as scribe. We had ZM, MJ, IS, SS, MC, and BJ present Problems 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, and 2.11, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 19:</b> Productive day!  We got caught up with some time to spare.  After a quick review of some key concepts, we had AA, JW, JB, AC, AS, and CH present Problems 2.12, 2.13(a), 2.13(b), 2.13(c), 2.14, and 2.18, respectively.  Along the way, I presented Problem 2.17.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, August 21:</b> Coming soon.</li>
</ul>
