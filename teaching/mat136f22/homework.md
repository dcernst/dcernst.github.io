## Guidelines ##
You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in their own work. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed to turn in **up to two late homework assignments**. Reviewing material from previous courses and looking up definitions and theorems you may have forgotten is fair game. However, when it comes to completing assignments for this course, you should *not* look to resources outside the context of this course for help.  That is, you should not be consulting the web, other texts, other faculty, or students outside of our course in an attempt to find solutions to the problems you are assigned.  This includes Chegg and Course Hero. On the other hand, you may use each other, the textbook, me, and your own intuition. **If you feel you need additional resources, please come talk to me and we will come up with an appropriate plan of action.** Please read NAU's [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www5.nau.edu/policies/Client/Details/828?whoIsLooking=Students&pertainsTo=All&sortDirection=Ascending&page=1).

There are many resources available to assist you with doing your homework (e.g., office hours, Discord discussion group, free tutoring at numerous places across campus). You are strongly encouraged to ask questions in our Discord discussion group, as I (and hopefully other members of the class) will post comments there for all to benefit from.  You are also encouraged to stop by during my office hours and you can always [email me](mailto:dana.ernst@nau.edu).  Lastly, *free* tutoring is available through the [Math Achievement Program](https://in.nau.edu/academic-success-centers/math-achievement-program/).

Unless a student has a documented excused absence, late homework will not be accepted.

## Weekly Homework ##
For each of the Weekly Homework assignments, answer each of the indicated questions. To receive full credit on a problem, you must show sufficient work for each of your answers (unless stated otherwise).  How you reach your answer is more important than the answer itself. I expect your solutions to be *well-written*, *neat*, and *organized*.  Do not turn in rough drafts.  What you turn in should be the polished version of potentially several drafts.

- **Weekly Homework 1:** Complete the problems posted [here]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat136f22/136Weekly1.pdf). (Due Thursday, September 8 at class time)
- **Weekly Homework 2:** Complete the problems posted [here]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat136f22/136Weekly2.pdf). (Due Thursday, September 15 at class time)
