We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

After attempting to learn names, I gave a very quick tour of the course webpage and discussed in general terms what a typical class meeting would look like.  Next, I gave a brief summary of what "abstract algebra" is and then jumped into Chapter 2 and started discussing Spinpossible.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, January 12:</b> Great first day of presentations!
