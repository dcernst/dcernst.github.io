## Instructions ##
You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in their own work. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed to turn in **up to two late homework assignments**. Reviewing material from previous courses and looking up definitions and theorems you may have forgotten is fair game. However, when it comes to completing assignments for this course, you should *not* look to resources outside the context of this course for help.  That is, you should not be consulting the web, other texts, other faculty, or students outside of our course in an attempt to find solutions to the problems you are assigned.  This includes Chegg and Course Hero. On the other hand, you may use each other, the textbook, me, and your own intuition. **If you feel you need additional resources, please come talk to me and we will come up with an appropriate plan of action.** Please read NAU's [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www5.nau.edu/policies/Client/Details/828?whoIsLooking=Students&pertainsTo=All&sortDirection=Ascending&page=1).

## Assignments ##
I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises.  

- **Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat690s22/syllabus/) and write down 5 important items. *Note:*  All of the exam dates only count as a single item. Also, create a free [Discord](http://discord.com) account, accept the invite to our Discord server, and post something about yourself in the #introductions channel. (Due Wednesday, January 12)
- **Homework 2:**  Coming soon. (Due Wednesday, January 19)
