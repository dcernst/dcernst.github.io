We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.
</p>

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, August 28:</b> First day! The first few minutes of class were devoted to me attempting to learn names. Next, I summarized the first few homework assignments, which was followed by a whirlwind tour of the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat220f17/">course webpage</a>. After this, the students engaged in an exercise aimed at understanding "productive struggle". This exercise is the second half of the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/SettingTheStage.pdf">Setting the Stage</a> activity.  The remaining portion of class was devoted to highlighting some key items on the syllabus.
</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, August 30:</b> The first few minutes of class were devoted to learning names and making sure there weren't any questions about the syllabus.  Next, we had a quick discuss about writing code to solve some of the problems. For the record, I'm totally fine with students occasionally taking this approach.  However, it is important to reflect on the meaning of the output.  We also discussed trying to avoid "legal battles" when interpreting the wording of problems. This was followed by a quick discussion of Problem 1 involving taxi fares.  We then split the class up into 6 small groups, where each group was responsible for one of Problems 3, 4, 5, 6(a), 6(b), and 6(c). After a few minutes we came back together to discuss the problems.  Our very first presentation was given by OW. She presented Problem 3 (1000 doors in a hallway) and did an excellent job! With the time we had left had EB and HR present Problem 5 (sticks in a bag) and Problem 4 (triangles with toothpicks), respectively. Both of these presentations were also great.  I'm very happy with how things went today. Unfortunately, we didn't get to Problem 6. The plan is tackle the 3 parts of this problem during the next class.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, September 1:</b> Another busy but productive day.  After I lead a discussion about Problem 6(a) (Variation 1 of pebbles on a chessboard), we started tackling Problems 6(c), 6(c), 7, and 8, all of which deal with pebbles on a chessboard. DC and MF presented solutions to Problems 6(b) and 6(c).  I took the lead on discussing Problems 7 and 8 and along the way, MG provided some key insights.  Next, JG presented a proposed solution to Problem 9 and KC verified the solution was optimal.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, September 4:</b> Labor Day, no class!</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, September 6:</b> I was surprised how much we accomplished today.  After a quick discussion of the upcoming quiz, we split the class up into 8 small groups, where each group was tasked with discussing their proposed solution to one of Problems 10-13.  When all was said and done, we had AT, MF, HR, and QS present solutions to Problems 10, 11, 12, and 13, respectively.  Our discussion of Problem 13 (ants on a log) was a bit rushed, so I hope to return to that one on Monday (since we have a quiz on Friday).</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, September 8:</b> The students took Quiz 1.</li>
</ul>

## Week 3 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, September 11:</b> The week is off to a good start.  After a few quick announcement, we split the class up into 5 small groups.  After a few minutes, we had YS, OW, VM, AG, and KR present solutions for Problems 14, 15(algebraic), 15(visual), 16, and 17, respectively (but not in that order as KR actually went first).  I meant to revisit Problem 11, but I completely forgot, so we'll have to do that at another time.  We had some time left at the end, which we devoted to discussing the upcoming problems.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, September 13:</b> While I was out today, Monika Keindl covered for me.  My understanding is that JK, KS/DO, VM, and MG presented their proposed solutions to Problems 18, 19,20, and 21, respectively. There was also some preliminary discussion of Problem 22.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, September 15:</b> Nandor Sieben covered for me today.  It appears that EB, KW/KR, VM, and HR presented Problems 22, 23, 24, and 25, respectively.</li>
</ul>

## Week 4 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, September 18:</b> After some discussion about Problems 22 and 23, we started discussing Problem 27, which is a lot more involved than it looks at first glance.  As a class, we discussed the cases of 2, 3, 4, and 5 orbs.  We also got most of the way through discussing the cases involving 6 orbs.  Along the way, we heard from QS, EB, TN, JR, AT, MG, HR, and KW.  The goal is for the students to wrap up the cases involving 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 orbs.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, September 20:</b> After a few announcements, the students formed 8 small groups with 3 students each.  Each group was tasked with discussing 2 of the 4 problems that were currently outstanding.  After 10 minutes or so, we started having students share out.  We had MQ, JL/JK, JR, and SS present solutions or ideas for Problems 26, 27, 28, and 29, respectively.  Problems 26 and 27 are still outstanding. VM conjectured a solution to Problem 26 and students were asked to prove this for Monday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, September 22:</b> The students took Quiz 2.</li>
</ul>

<!--
## Week 5 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, February 13:</b> We accomplished more today than I expected.  We kicked off with small groups discussing potential solutions to Problem 25. We had JS1 share a solution he encountered when chatting with his group. Next, we had JS2 share his proposed solution to Problem 26, but we discovered it wasn't optimal because RB proposed a better solution.  I suggested folks attempt to prove that RB's solution is the best we can do.  After having AT2 share his proposed approach to Problem 27, we had BG present slick solutions to both Problems 27 and 28.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, February 15:</b> The students took <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat220f17/220Quiz2.pdf">Quiz 2</a>.  I love watching the students collaborate for the few minutes I allow them to chat.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, February 17:</b> I was energetic today, but I might have been the only one.  We started with a brief follow-up discussion on Problems 27 and 28.  NP told us how we could take the solutions from Problems 27 and 28 and combine them into a single strategy.  Next, KG provided an argument about why 17 minutes is the best we can do on Problem 26.  AT2 put Problem 33 to rest with easy; another example of triangular numbers.  RD and AT1 tackled Problem 34 for us. I think everyone should be able to handle any problem like this one in the future.  We spend the last 20 minutes of class discussing Problem 35.  LL and RB presented their proposed solutions, but it turns out that we can do better.  We'll revisit Problem 35 next week.</li>
</ul>

## Week 6 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, February 20:</b> Unfortunately, I spent almost the entire class talking.  I spent a good chunk of time going over Quiz 2 and then wrote down a complete solution to Problem 35 involving 12 coins.  There was a few minutes at the end for students to think about what to do with 11 coins.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, February 22:</b> Great day! BS presented Problem 37, which illustrated the importance of working backwards. Next MS walked us through Problem 38. I followed this up with a discussion of how to explicitly count the number of friendships on each team. This lead to a brief discussion about how to generalize the problem. KG attempted Problem 39, but his approach was thwarted by an inability to resolve one inequality. KF followed this up with an elegant solution involving the triangle inequality. We wrapped up class with a short discussion of Problem 40, which turns out to not work as expected.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, February 24:</b> The students took <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat220f17/220Quiz3.pdf">Quiz 3</a>.</li>
</ul>

## Week 7 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, February 27:</b> I had surgery on my back this morning and I will be out for 2 weeks.  In my absence, Dr. Wilson is covering for me.  My understanding is that MS presented an elegant solution to Problem 41 and then there was some general discussion of Problems 42 and 43.  These problems and likely a couple more will be tackled on Wednesday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, March 1:</b> The word on the street is that after some discussion of Problem 42 (Bin Laden), KG and RB presented the cases for $n=5$ and $n=7$ for Problem 43 (Martian Artifacts), respectively which was followed up with some general discussion of the cases involving $n=2k$ versus $n=2k-1$. Next, RD, followed by MS, presented their proposed solutions to Problem 44 (Aslant).</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, March 3:</b> Rumor has it that the following transpired: KG tackled the case with $n=9$ for Problem 43, RD led a discussion for Problem 45, and then MS and NP presented for Problem 46.</li>
</ul>

## Week 8 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, March 6:</b> My understanding is that KP presented Problem 44 (Aslant), MS finished off Problem 43 (Martian Artifacts), RB and AC tackled Problem 48 (Magic!), and RD presented Problem 49 (Two Deep).</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, March 8:</b> Today MS presented Problem 46 (the one with the $3\times 3$ and $2\times 2$ squares), RD presented Problem 45 (Double Tangent), SS and BS presented Problem 52 (One Over), and KG presented Problem 51 (The Good Teacher), but there was an algebra mistake in Problem 51, so we haven't found a solution to that one yet.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, March 10:</b> The students took <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat220f17/220Quiz4.pdf">Quiz 4</a>.</li>
</ul>

## Week 9 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, March 20:</b> After checking in and making a few announcements, we divided the class up into 11 small groups, where each groups was tasked with coming to consensus on one of multiple parts of the homework problems.  We had LB, JJ, SS, JK, SW, JM, MR, LL, BS, AT2, and RB present Problems 54(a), 54(b), 55(a), 55(b), 55(c), 55(d), 55(e), 55(f), 55(g), 55(h), and 55(i), respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, March 22:</b> We finally saw solutions to Problem 50 (Checkermate) and Problem 53 (Quilt), which were presented by RD and BG, respectively.  Next, AC tackled Problem 56(a). The solutions had an error, but the essence of it was correct. After this, I explained how we could model the soul-swapping via "string diagrams". This was followed by a presentation of solutions of parts (b) and (c) for Problem 56 by KG.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, March 24:</b> After handing back Quiz 4, we had a brief discussion of Problem B1 from the quiz. Next, MR provided a solution to Problem 56(d), which involved the swapping of souls of 4 individuals. We spent a few minutes reframing the solution in terms of the one I hinted at the previous class and then discussed how to handle any soul swapping bonanza, which settled Problem 56(e). This was followed with NP providing a solution to the 2 real versus 2 counterfeit coins in Problem 57 (Zoltar). MS then presented an elegant solution to the 7 versus 7 case, which can easily be generalized to handle any $n$ versus $n$ case (for $n\geq 2$).  We wrapped up with BS presenting a solution to Problem 58 (chicken nuggets) and JM explained the code that he wrote to solve the problem.</li>
</ul>

## Week 10 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, March 27:</b> We finally saw a solution to Problem 50 (Good Teacher), which NP presented for us. Next, we split the class up into 6 small groups, each tasked with discussing one of Problems 59-61. After a few minutes, JS1 presented a solution to Problem 59 (Modified Sylver Coinage). Next, we heard from JK, AT2, and LB about Problem 60 (Cookies). Lastly, AT1 discussed the beautiful solution to Problem 61 (Prisoners and a light switch).</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, March 29:</b> The students took <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat220f17/220Quiz5.pdf">Quiz 5</a>.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, March 31:</b> Today, RB presented a wonderful solution to Problem 62. It appeared that no one had made much progress on on Problems 63 and 64, so we spent the rest of class kicking around some ideas about how to approach these problems.</li>
</ul>

## Week 11 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, April 3:</b> We started with a discussion about how to frame Problem 65 (7 positive integers and their gcd's mod 3) in terms of a graph with 7 vertices and edges that have been colored using 3 different colors.  The goal is the justify that there is always a triangle of the same color.  After discussing Problem 65, we split the class up into 3 small groups, which we tasked with discussing Problems 63-65, respectively.  We had KG share a solution to Problem 63, which was followed by a really nice solution to Problem 65 by LL.  We wrapped up with MR and RD discussing most of the details of Problem 64.  There is one remaining detail to resolve before we will have complete solution to Problem 64.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, April 5:</b> We finally nailed down Problem 64 (Federation ambassadors around table). After I got us up to speed with what we knew about the problem, MS and KG filled in the rest of the details.  Next, we had AC present an algebraic proof for Problem 66.  This was followed by attempts at a visual proof by SW, NP, and MR for the same problem.  We were pressed for time at the end, but JM was able to share his approach to Problem 67 before we departed.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, April 7:</b> Since Problem 67 was discussed so quickly on Monday, we revisited that problem first.  During our discussion, we heard from MR, BS, MS, and RD.  Next, JK presented a quick solution to Problem 69 (mellow yellow and high fructose thorn scallop). This was followed by presentations by AC, KG, MS, and MR for Problem 70 (ten people in a circle). Problem 68 (rectangle vs pentagon) was the last one we discussed.  MH shared his progress and then KG started to share his approach using the triangle inequality, but we ran out of time.  We will revisit this one on Monday.</li>
</ul>

## Week 12 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, April 10:</b> The first few minutes of class were devoted to wrapping up Problem 68 (rectangle vs pentagon), which I presented.  Next, SS led us on a discussion of Problem 71 (4 by 4 grid with lights) that involved some case analysis.  We attempted to generalize potential arguments to handle the 5 by 5 case and the 8 by 8 case.  We all believe the answer to Problem 72 (8 by 8 grid with lights) is that it is impossible to start with fewer than 8 lights, but the problem remains open.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, April 12:</b> The students took <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat220f17/220Quiz6.pdf">Quiz 6</a>.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, April 14:</b> We spent the first few minutes of class discussing my proposed solution to Problem 72 (8 by 8 grid with lights). Next, we quickly dispensed with Problem 74 (liars and truth tellers) and then moved onto Problem 73, which AT2 presented. Then SW led a discussion of Problem 75 (lions on an island). I spent the last few minutes of class discussing induction.</li>
</ul>

## Week 13 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, April 17:</b> After handing back Quiz 6, I briefly discussed Problems B1, B2, and B3.  This was followed by another discussion of induction. Next, AT1 and NP presented two different approaches to Problem 77 (sums of distinct powers of 2). Then BG presented Problem 76 ($n$ lines).</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, April 19:</b> More than half of the class period was spent discussing Google's PageRank, which was inspired by Problem 78 (who is the coolest?).  With the time we had left, NP and LL presented both parts of Problem 79 (infinite hotel). We'll come back to Problem 80 on Friday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, April 21:</b> We had JS1 and MR present Problem 80(a) and 80(b), respectively, which was followed by me presenting Problem 80(c).  Next, we heard from JK and KP on Problem 81.</li>
</ul>

## Week 14 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, April 24:</b> We had 4 different solutions to Problem 82.  Three of these were from SW, RD, and KG, and the fourth was from me.  Next, we saw a solution to Problem 83 by NP.  We spent the last few minutes of class reviewing for Wednesday's quiz.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, April 26:</b> The students took <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat220f17/220Quiz7.pdf">Quiz 7</a>.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, April 28:</b> We started by discussing Problem 85 (top player). RD discussed his intuition about the problem, but no one had a rigorous argument.  I walked us through an inductive proof (with some minor confusion on one case). With the time we had left, I guided a discussion of the first part of Problem 84.  The plan is to revisit this one and Problem 86 on Monday.</li>
</ul>

## Week 15 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, May 1:</b> First, I attempted to salvage a crappy presentation that I did for Problem 85 (top player), but more or less blew it again.  Maybe we will have time to come back to it at some point.  Next, MH waltzed through Problem 87(a) and explained a little bit of his thinking about part (c). This was followed by a very elegant solution to both (b) and (c) for Problem 87. JJ walked us through a different approach to Problem 87(b).  Ignoring my horrible hint on Problem 88 (all tetronimoes), AC cranked out all 5 possibilities.  The best part of class came next. When I asked for a solution to Problem 86 (papal vote), KG rambled off a quick justification, which I promptly dismissed.  I said something vague about why his approach wouldn't work and then asked for a different solution. BS suggested that I follow the hint I gave and outlined an approach.  We were all in agreement that this worked, but then some students asked again why KG's original proposed solution did not work.  I still wasn't convinced and again tried to push us away from it.  However, after class some students followed me back to my office and walked me through KG's proposed solution. It took me a few minutes to come around, but it turns out he and the other students were correct. In fact, KG's solution is better than the one I proposed since it is shorter and handles more possibilities.   I think I was hung up on my solution and couldn’t see what he and others were saying.  The best part of what happened is that no one backed down from me.  I think this is really cool.  You were convinced by KG’s argument and didn’t just change your mind because I said it didn’t hold.  Awesome. With the few minutes we had left at the end of class, KP provided a potential coloring for Problem 84.  I hope to wrap this one up on Wednesday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, May 3:</b> We got a lot done today! First, JS1 showed up possible solutions to parts (a), (b), (c), and (e) of Problem 89 (tiling with tetrominoes). AT2 provided an alternate solution to part (b). Next, MH showed us his take on Problem 91 (ages of 3 children), which was followed by a more accurate solution presented by LB.  Then we spent quite a bit of time discussing Problem 90 (tiling with L-shaped triominoes).  After coming up with some necessary conditions, we started hunting for sufficient conditions. BG provided the first key insight, which allowed us to dispense with the case involving at least one even dimension. To get us started on the case involving two odd dimensions, SS showed us how to tile a $5\times 9$ board, which set us up to handle the general case. I took the last few minutes to summarize all possible colorings of the number line for Problem 84.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, May 5:</b> A great last day!  First, we had RB show us a beautiful coloring of the $10\times 10$ grid for Problem 93.  Next, LL showed us potential tilings for part (a) and (b) of Problem 94.  Utilizing RB's coloring from Problem 93, RD proved that no tiling exists for part (c) of Problem 94.  This was followed by an attempt at unscrambling the signed permutation in Problem 95 by JJ, but he realized at the end that he had a flaw.  JK then showed us one potential unscrambling that had the desired number of moves. The last problem to be discussed this semester was Problem 92 (tiling a board with a missing square with L-shaped triominoes).  BG got us started, but we discovered that his solution was quite general enough. BS presented an elegant solution to the problem involving induction. With the few minutes we had left at the end, we spent some time reflecting on the semester.  I'm pleased with how things went, but have several ideas for how to improve the course.</li>
