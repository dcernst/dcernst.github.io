We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, January 14:</b> First day! The first few minutes of class were devoted to me attempting to learn names. I think I got them all! Next, we did a very quick tour of BbLearn and the course website.  The remainder of the class meeting was devoted to discussing isomorphisms as they occur in multiple mathematical contexts.  We concluded with an example of a continuous bijection whose inverse is not continuous.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, January 16:</b> After answering a few quick questions about the syllabus, we jumped into student presentations.  We had AS, FA, JH, WC, and SM present Theorem 2.2, Exercise 2.3, visual for Exercise 2.3, Theorem 2.6, and Theorem 2.7, respectively. We ran out of time for Theorem 2.8 and we will address that one at the beginning of class on Friday.  Great first day of student presentations!</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, January 18:</b> Another good day of student presentations.  We did not get through everything that was planned, but we should be able to catch up.  We had RD, PB, JN, and MS present Theorems 2.8, 2.9, 2.10(forward implication), and 2.10(reverse implication), respectively.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, January 21:</b> MLK Day, no class.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, January 21:</b> We devoted the first few minutes of class to discussing the relationship between the Axiom of Choice, the Well Ordering Theorem, and Zorn's Lemma, as well as the relationship between the Well Ordering Property and the Axiom of Induction. Next, we had RB/JW, QC, and PH presented Theorems 2.11, 2.12, and 2.13, respectively.  I'm really pleased with how things are progressing.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, January 18:</b> After discussing the basics of LaTeX, we divided the class up into five small groups, were each group was tasked with putting their proposed proof to an assigned theorem on the board. We had AB, JB, and PB share their group's proof for Theorems 2.14, 2.16, and 2.18, respectively.  We didn't have time to discuss Theorems 2.19 and 2.20.  We'll kick off with Theorem 2.20 next time.</li>
</ul>

## Week 3 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, January 28:</b> First, we had MS and VM present Theorems 2.20 and 2.21, respectively.  Then we had EP and RB present Theorems 2.19 and 2.22, respectively.  This was followed with a quick summary of the Schroeder-Bernstein Theorems.  With the time we had left, we discussed the definitions of topology and topological space and tinkered with some examples.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, January 30:</b> AB, JH, FA, RD, AS, and ZF presented Theorem 3.3, Exercise 3.6(discrete), Exercise 3.6(indiscrete), Exercise 3.6(co-finite), Exercise 3.6(co-countable), and Exercise 3.7, respectively.  Along the way, we also discussed Exercises 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, February 1:</b> We divided the class up into a few small groups and then had RD, SM, PH, EP, RH, and QC present Exercise 3.8(indiscrete and co-finite), Exercise 3.8(standard and discrete), Exercise 3.10, Exercise 3.11(1)(2), Exercise 3.11(3)(4), and Exercise 3.12(1)(2), respectively.</li>
</ul>

## Week 4 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, February 4:</b> We didn't cover much ground today, but that's okay. We spent a good chunk of time reviewing the key concepts related open and closed sets and then I presented a proof of Theorem 3.13.  We took our time with this, which didn't leave a lot of time for much else.  We had JW present Theorem 3.14. The second implication in Theorem 3.14 was a little rushed due to time constraints, so we will likely revisit it next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, February 6:</b> The first few minutes were devoted to summarizing some recent key concepts and setting the stage for what is coming later in the semester.  We had JW, JN, and YD present Theorem 3.14, Theorem 3.15, and Theorem 3.16, respectively. After the student presentations, we chatted about Exercises 3.17 and 3.18 together as a class.</li>
