## Problem Sequence ##
We will not be using a traditional textbook this semester, but rather a problem sequence adopted for an [inquiry-based learning](http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html) (IBL) approach to abstract algebra. The problem sequence will be written by me on the fly. The problems will be released incrementally.

I will not be covering every detail of the notes and the only way to achieve a sufficient understanding of the material is to be digesting the reading in a meaningful way.  You should be seeking clarification about the content of the notes whenever necessary by asking questions.  Here's one of my favorite quotes about reading mathematics.

<blockquote>
  <p>Donâ€™t just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?</p>
