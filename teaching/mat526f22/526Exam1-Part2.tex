\newpage

\begin{enumerate}

	
\item (4 points each) Complete all of the following. For this problem, let $d_n:=|\Dyck(n)|$.
\begin{enumerate}

\item Prove that $d_n=C_n$ by describing a bijection between $S_n(231)$ and $\Dyck(n)$. Do this in a way that maximal decreasing runs of a permutation correspond to peaks of a Dyck path. There are a few different ways to attack this problem, but one way is to think of 231-avoiding permutations as non-attacking rook arrangements (ask me if you don't know what this means).  See if you can find a natural correspondence to a Dyck path for a given non-attacking rook arrangement for a 231-avoiding permutation. For your ``reverse" map, be sure to argue that your resulting permutation truly is 231-avoiding.  Notice that if $w\mapsto p$, then 
\[
\pk(p)=\decruns(w)=\asc(w)+1=n-1-\des(w)+1=n-\des(w),
\]
and so $\des(w)=n-\pk(p)$. This verifies that
\[
N_{n,n-k-1}=|\{p\in\Dyck(n)\mid \pk(p)=k+1\}|.
\]
%\item Argue that the number of lattice paths (not just Dyck paths) from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ is equal to $\binom{2n}{n}$.
%\item Argue that the number of lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n+1,n-1)$ is equal to $\binom{2n}{n-1}$.
\item Prove that there is a bijection from the set of lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ that pass below $y=x$ at least once to the set of lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n+1,n-1)$.  \emph{Hint:} Consider the first point on lattice path from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ that passes below $y=x$. Reflect the remaining portion of the path over the appropriate line to get a path from $(0,0)$ to $(n+1,n-1)$.
\item Prove that $\displaystyle d_n=\binom{2n}{n}-\binom{2n}{n-1}$. \emph{Hint:} Use part~(b). %The number of lattice paths (not just Dyck paths) from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ is equal to $\displaystyle\binom{2n}{n}$ while the number of lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n+1,n-1)$ is equal to $\displaystyle\binom{2n}{n-1}$.

%\item Prove that $\displaystyle \binom{2n}{n}-\binom{2n}{n-1} = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}$.
\end{enumerate}
You just proved that $C_n=\displaystyle \binom{2n}{n}-\binom{2n}{n-1}$, and it is easy to verify that $\displaystyle \binom{2n}{n}-\binom{2n}{n-1} = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}$, so that $C_n=\displaystyle\frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}$, as well.
	
\item (4 points each) Complete \textbf{two} of the following.
\begin{enumerate}

\item Verify that the proposed bijection $\phi:S_n(231)\to \NC(n)$ that was presented in class during the first week of classes is indeed a well-defined bijection that maps maximal decreasing runs to blocks of a noncrossing partition. In this case, the issue of being well defined boils down to verifying that the image of $\phi$ truly is a subset of $\NC(n)$.  To verify that $\phi$ is a bijection, describe the ``reverse" map (and verify that it does indeed map to $S_n(231)$).  Note that this bijection satisfies $\des(w)=n-|\phi(w)|$ (where $|\phi(w)|$ is the number of blocks in the partition). It follows that
\[
N_{n,k}=|\{\pi\in\NC(n)\mid |\pi|=n-k\}.
\]

%\item A sequence of parentheses is balanced if it can be parsed syntactically. In other words, there should be the same number of left parentheses ``(" and right parentheses ``)", and when reading from left to right there should never be more right parentheses than left. Here are the five balanced parenthesizations containing three pairs:
%\[
%()()(), ()(()), (()()), (())(), ((())).
%\]
%Prove that the number of balanced sequences of $n$ pairs of parentheses is $\displaystyle \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}$. \emph{Hint:} Do not try to count directly! Instead use a bijection.

\item A \textbf{triangulation} of a convex $(n+2)$-gon is a dissection into $n$ triangles using only lines from vertices to vertices. Think of the polygon as being fixed in space. Prove that the number of triangulations of a convex $(n+2)$-gon is $C_n$. Incidentally, this is the problem that Euler was interested in when he studied the Catalan numbers!

%\item A \textbf{standard Young tableau} is a two dimensional array of numbers (from 1 to the number of entries in the array) that increases across rows and down columns. Let $\SYT(2, n)$ denote the collection of standard Young tableaux in a $2\times n$ rectangular array. Prove that $|\SYT(2, n)|=C_n$.

\item Prove that $C_n$ counts the number of ways we can stack coins in the plane such that the bottom row consists of $n$ consecutive coins.  You should think of this as the two-dimensional version of stacking apples.  For example, here are all the ways to stack coins so that the bottom row has 3 coins.

\end{center}

\newpage

\item Consider a rectangle with $n$ nodes across the top edge and $n$ nodes across the bottom edge.  A \textbf{Temperley--Lieb $n$-diagram} in the rectangle consists of $n$ edges connecting the $2n$ nodes such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item each edge connects a pair of nodes,
\item each node is connected to exactly one edge,
\item the edges must be drawn inside the rectangle,
\item none of the edges are allowed to cross or touch.
\end{itemize}
Below is an example of a 6-diagram.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]
\draw[gray,thick] (0,0) rectangle (7,2);
\foreach \x in {1,2,3,4,5,6} \filldraw (\x,0) circle (1pt);
\foreach \x in {1,2,3,4,5,6} \filldraw (\x,2) circle (1pt);
\draw (3,0) to [bend left=60] (6,0);
\draw (2,0) to [out=70,in=-105] (6,2);
\draw (4,0) to [bend left=60] (5,0);
\draw (1,2) to [bend right=60] (2,2);
\draw (1,0) to [out=80,in=-115] (5,2);
\draw (3,2) to [bend right=60] (4,2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Let $\TL(n)$ denote the collection of $n$-diagrams. Prove that $|TL(n)|=C_n$.

%\item Tickets to a show are 50 cents and $2n$ customers stand in a queue at the ticket window.  Half of them have \$1 and the others have 50 cents.  The cashier starts with no money. How many arrangements of the queue are possible with the proviso that the cashier always be able to make change?

\item Let $L(k,n-k)$ denote the set of lattice paths $p$ from $(0,0)$ to $(k,n-k)$ consisting of only North steps and East steps. Note that each path in $L(k,n-k)$ consists of $k$ East steps and $n-k$ North steps for a total of $n$ steps. Construct a bijection between $L(k,n-k)$ and the set $\{w\in S_n\mid \Des(w)\subseteq \{k\}\}$. \emph{Note:} Notice that says ``$\subseteq$" not ``$=$".

\item Prove that for $n\geq 1$ and $0\leq k\leq n-1$, the Narayana numbers have the following symmetry property: $N_{n,k}=N_{n,n-k-1}$.

\end{enumerate}

%\item (4 points each) Complete \textbf{two} of the following.
%\begin{enumerate}

%\item The \textbf{wicked awesome sorting length} of a permutation $w=w(1)\cdots w(n)\in S_n$, denoted $\ell(w)$, to be the minimal number of adjacent swaps of positions needed to sort the permutation to the identity. For example, $31542$ has wicked awesome sorting length at most 5 since the permutation can be unscrambled in five moves as follows:
%\[
%31\underline{54}2 \to 314\underline{52} \to 31\underline{42}5 \to \underline{31}245 \to 1\underline{32}45 \to 12345.
%\]
%In fact, $\ell(31542)$ is exactly 5. Prove that $\inv(w)=\ell(w)$ for all $w\in S_n$. \emph{Hint:} Start by proving that applying an adjacent swap to positions of a permutation either increases the number of inversions by one or decreases the number of inversions by one, and then describe an unscrambling algorithm that decreases the number of inversions after each swap.

%\item (Hanoi Solitaire) Consider a deck of $n$ cards labeled $1,2,\ldots, n$. An arrangement of the cards is denoted $c_1c_2\cdots c_n$, where $c_1$ is the number corresponding to the top card and $c_n$ is the number corresponding to the bottom card.  We now describe a type of solitaire involving three piles of cards. Our starting configuration is an empty left pile, $c_1c_2\cdots c_n$ in the middle, and an empty right pile. We then employ the following algorithm:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item[(1)] Move the current top card $c_i$ of the middle pile to the top of the left pile if the left pile is empty or if $c_i$ is smaller than the current top card $c_j$ of the left pile.
%\item[(2)] Otherwise, move the top card $c_j$ from the left pile to the bottom of the right pile. 
%\end{enumerate}
%Let $h(c_1c_2\cdots c_n)$ denote the final arrangement of the cards in the right pile. We say that $c_1c_2\cdots c_n$ is a \emph{winning arrangement} if $h(c_1c_2\cdots c_n)=12\cdots n$, and otherwise, $c_1c_2\cdots c_n$ is called a \emph{losing arrangement}. If $n$ is the $i$th card, first prove that 
%\[
%h(c_1\cdots c_{i-1}nc_{i+1}\cdots c_n)=h(c_1\cdots c_{i-1})h(c_{i+1}\cdots c_n)n,
%\]
%and then use this to find the number of winning arrangements of $n$ cards. \emph{Hint:} Induction could come in handy depending on your approach. \emph{Note:} This problem is awesome!

%\end{enumerate}

\item (4 points) Complete \textbf{one} of the following.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A \textbf{set composition} of a set $S$ is a set partition with an ordering on its blocks. When writing a set composition of $[n]$, it is standard practice to write the elements in each block in increasing order. This allows us to abbreviate a set composition of $[n]$ as a sequence of increasing runs separated by vertical bars. For example, the set composition $(\{3\},\{4,6\},\{1,5,2\})$ would be written as $3|46|125$. Using this model, each set composition of $[n]$ is associated with a permutation on $n$. For example, the ``underlying" permutation in the example above is $346125$. Notice that each permutation $w\in S_n$ is associated with potentially many set compositions and we must always place a bar in a descent position. Moreover, we can place additional bars in the gaps between numbers in the permutation, but we are only allowed to place a single bar (since blocks must be nonempty). Let $\mathcal{C}(w)$ denote the collection of set compositions with underlying permutation $w$. Prove that
\[
\sum_{C\in\mathcal{C}(w)}t^{|C|}=t^{\runs(w)}(1+t)^{n-\runs(w)},
\]
where $|C|$ denotes the number of blocks in the set composition $C$ and $\runs(w)$ is the number of maximal increasing runs in $w$.

%\item A \textbf{derangement} is a permutation such that $w(i)\neq i$ for all $i$ (i.e., $w$ has no fixed points). Let $d_n$ denote the number of derangements of $[n]$ with $d_0:=1$. Find a closed form for the exponential generating function for $d_n$:
%\[
%D(z):=\sum_{n\geq 0}d_n\frac{z^n}{n!}.
%\]

\item Define the ordinary generating function for the Catalan numbers via
\[
C(z):=\sum_{n\geq 0}C_nz^n.
\]
Prove that $\displaystyle C(z)=\frac{1-\sqrt{1-4z}}{2z}$.  \emph{Hint:} Peel off first term of sum, utilize Catalan recurrence to obtain a double sum, do some clever rearranging to obtain $z$ times a product of two sums, each of which ends up equaling $C(z)$.  At this point, you should end up with an equation that is quadratic in $C(z)$.  Use the quadratic formula and ditch the solution that cannot occur.

\item For a fixed $n\geq 1$, define the \textbf{Narayana polynomial} via
\[
C_n(t):=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}N_{n,k}t^k=\sum_{w\in S_n(231)}t^{\des(w)}.
\]
Also, define $C_0(t):=1$. Prove that
\[
C_n(t)=C_{n-1}(t)+\sum_{i=0}^{n-2}C_i(t)C_{n-1-i}(t).
\]
\emph{Hint:} Refine the argument we used to prove the Catalan recurrence.

%\item For $w=w(1)\cdots w(n)\in S_n$ define the \textbf{trace} of $w$, denoted $\tr(w)$, to be the sum of the positions of the descents of $w$. Prove that
%\[
%\sum_{w\in S_n}t^{\tr(w)}=\sum_{w\in S_n}t^{\inv(w)}.
%\]
%\emph{Note:} If $\Tr_n(t)$ is the generating function for the number of permutations in $S_n$ with trace equal to $k$, we have shown that $\displaystyle \Tr_n(t)=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^n(1-t^i)}{(1-t)^n}$ since this is the formula we found for $I_n(t)$ on Homework~7.

%\item Let $\coins_n$ be the number of ways to make change for $n$ cents using pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters. Let $F_{\coins}(z)$ be the generating function for $\coins_n$:
%\[
%F_{\coins}(z):=\sum_{n\geq 0}\coins_nz^n.
%\]
%Prove that 
%\[
%F_{\coins}(z)=\frac{1}{(1-z)(1-z^5)(1-z^{10})(1-z^{25})}.
%\]

\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

%\textbf{Bonus Question!} (2 points) This question is optional.  Use a computer algebra system (e.g., WolframAlpha, Mathematica, Sage/CoCalc, Maple, etc.) together with the expression for $F_{\coins}(z)$ to find the number of ways to make change for \$1.

%scraps: 

%\item Prove that a permutation $w\in S_n$ is uniquely determined by its inversion set $\Inv(w)$.

%\item Stirling numbers of the first kind (see IBL pages 59--63).

%\item Prove that the number of sequences consisting of $n$ ones and $n$ negative ones such that every partial sum is nonnegative is $C_n$.

%\item The book describes a bijection from $S_n(231)$ to $\Dyck(n)$ in Section~2.4.3, which shows that $C_n=|S_n(231)|=|\Dyck(n)|$. However, many details are missing.  A \textbf{peak} of a Dyck path $p$ is a point $(i,j)$ along the path in the plane such that $(i,j-1)$ and $(i+1,j)$ are also on $p$. In other works, a peak occurs at a point along the path where there is a North step following by an East step. Let $\pk(p)$ denote the number of peaks on the Dyck path $p$.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Explain why reversing the map $\psi$ defined in the book will yield a 231-avoiding permutation.
%\item Prove that $\displaystyle C_n(t)=\sum_{p\in \Dyck(n)}t^{\pk(p)-1}$.
%\end{enumerate}

%\item Explain why $0\leq \tr(w)\leq \binom{n}{2}$ for all $w\in S_n$.
