\section*{Instructions}

Answer each of the following questions. This exam is worth a total of 65 points.  This exam is due by 5\textsc{pm} on \textbf{Thursday, December 15}. Your overall score on the Final Exam is worth 20\% of your overall grade. Good luck and have fun!

\bigskip

I expect your solutions to be \emph{well-written, neat, and organized}.  Do not turn in rough drafts.  What you turn in should be the ``polished'' version of potentially several drafts.  Feel free to type up your final version.  The \LaTeX\ source file of this exam is also available if you are interested in typing up your solutions using \LaTeX.  I'll gladly help you do this if you'd like.

\bigskip

Reviewing material from previous courses and looking up definitions and theorems you may have forgotten is fair game. However, when it comes to completing the following problems, you should \emph{not} look to resources outside the context of this course for help.  That is, you should not be consulting the web, other texts, other faculty, or students outside of our course in an attempt to find solutions to the problems you are assigned.  This includes Chegg and Course Hero. On the other hand, you may use each other, the textbook, me, and your own intuition. Further information:
\begin{enumerate}
\item You may freely use any theorems that we have discussed in class, but you should make it clear where you are using a previous result and which result you are using.  %For example, if a sentence in your proof follows from Problem 3.16, then you should say so.
\item Unless you prove them, you cannot use any results from the course notes/book that we have not yet covered.
\item You are \textbf{NOT} allowed to consult external sources when working on the exam.  This includes people outside of the class, other textbooks, and online resources.
\item You are \textbf{NOT} allowed to copy someone else's work.
\item You are \textbf{NOT} allowed to let someone else copy your work.
\item You are allowed to discuss the problems with each other and critique each other's work.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
\textbf{I will vigorously pursue anyone suspected of breaking these rules.}
\end{center}

You should \textbf{turn in this cover page} and all of the work that you have decided to submit. \textbf{Please write your solutions and proofs on your own paper.} To convince me that you have read and understand the instructions, sign in the box below.

\item (8 points) Complete \textbf{one} of the following problems.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find an explicit bijection between triangulations of a convex $(n+2)$-gon and $\PB(n)$.

%\item Tickets to a show are 50 cents and $2n$ customers stand in a queue at the ticket window.  Half of them have \$1 and the others have 50 cents.  The cashier starts with no money. How many arrangements of the queue are possible with the proviso that the cashier always be able to make change?

\item A standard Young tableau is a two dimensional array of numbers (from 1 to the number of entries in the array) that increases across rows and down columns. Let $SYT(2, n)$ denote the number of standard Young tableaux in a $2\times n$ rectangular array. Enumerate $|\SYT(2,n)|$.

For example, $\{\{1,3\},\{2,4\}\}$ is non-nesting while $\{\{1,4\},\{2,3\}\}$ is not.  Enumerate the number of non-nesting partitions of $[n]$.

\end{enumerate}

\item (8 points) Complete \textbf{one} of the following problems.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Recall the definition of parking function given on Part 2 of Exam 2.  A parking function $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ is called \emph{increasing} if $a_i\leq a_{i+1}$ for $1\leq i\leq n-1$. Count the number of increasing parking functions of length $n$.

\item Let $C^{>1}_{\text{odd}}(n)$ denote the collection of compositions of $[n]$  such that each part is odd and greater than one. Find a recurrence (including necessary initial conditions) for $|C^{>1}_{\text{odd}}(n)|$.

\item Recall the definition of derangements and the corresponding sequence $d_n$ given on Part 1 of Exam 1. Find a closed form for the exponential generating function for $d_n$:
\[
D(z):=\sum_{n\geq 0}d_n\frac{z^n}{n!}.
\]

\end{enumerate}

\item (8 points each) Complete \textbf{three} of the following problems.

Define inversions, descents, and the major index for permutations of $M$ exactly the way we did for permutations without repetition. Let $P(M)$ denote the set of permutations of $M$. Prove that

(1+t)(1+qt)(1+q^2t)\cdots (1+q^{n-1}t)=\sum_{k=0}^nq^{\binom{k}{2}}\qbinom{n}{k}_qt^k.

\[
P(G;t)=\sum_{k=1}^{|V|}p_k(G)\binom{t}{k}k!=\sum_{k=1}^{|V|}p_k(G)t(t-1)\cdots (t-k+1).
\]

\item Prove that if $P$ and $Q$ be locally finite posets with unique minimal elements $\hat{0}_P$ and $\hat{0}_Q$, respectively, then for all $p\in P$ and $q\in Q$, we have $\mu_{P\times Q}(p,q)=\mu_P(p)\mu_Q(q)$.

\item Let $B_n$ denote the poset $(\mathcal{P}([n],\subseteq)$.  Compute the characteristic polynomial of $B_n$.

\item If $P$ and $Q$ are finite ranked posets, prove that the characteristic polynomial of $P\times Q$ satisfies $\rchi(P\times Q)=\rchi(P)\rchi(Q)$.
