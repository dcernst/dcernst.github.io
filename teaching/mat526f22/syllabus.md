<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?</p>

### Rights of the Learner ##
As a student in this class, you have the right:

1. to be confused,
2. to make a mistake and to revise your thinking,
3. to speak, listen, and be heard, and
4. to enjoy doing mathematics.

### Commitment to the Learning Community ###
In our classroom, diversity and individual differences are respected, appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. Students in this class are encouraged and expected to speak up and participate during class and to carefully and respectfully listen to each other. Every member of this class *must* show respect for every other member of this class. Any attitudes or actions that are destructive to the sense of community that we strive to create are not welcome and will not be tolerated. In summary: Be good to each other. I would appreciate private responses to the following question: Are there aspects of your identity that you would like me to attend to when forming groups, and if so, how?

Students are also expected to minimize distracting behaviors.  In particular, every attempt should be made to arrive to class on time.  If you must arrive late or leave early, please do not disrupt class. Please turn off the ringer on your cell phone.  I do not have a strict policy on the use of laptops, tablets, and cell phones.  You are expected to be paying attention and engaging in class discussions.  If your cell phone, etc. is interfering with your ability (or that of another student) to do this, then put it away, or I will ask you to put it away.

### Rules of the Game ###
Reviewing material from previous courses and looking up definitions and theorems you may have forgotten is fair game. However, when it comes to completing assignments for this course, you should *not* look to resources outside the context of this course for help.  That is, you should not be consulting the web, other texts, other faculty, or students outside of our course in an attempt to find solutions to the problems you are assigned.  This includes Chegg and Course Hero. On the other hand, you may use each other, the textbook, me, and your own intuition. **If you feel you need additional resources, please come talk to me and we will come up with an appropriate plan of action.** Please read NAU's [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www5.nau.edu/policies/Client/Details/828?whoIsLooking=Students&pertainsTo=All&sortDirection=Ascending&page=1).

</blockquote>

### Homework ###
You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework.  However, each student is expected to turn in their own work.  Prior to the start of class, you will need to capture your handwritten work digitally and then upload a PDF to BbLearn. There are many free smartphone apps for doing this. I use TurboScan on my iPhone. Submitting your work prior to class allows me to see what you accomplished outside of class. In general, late homework will *not* be accepted.  However, you are allowed to turn in up to **two late homework assignments** with no questions asked. Unless you have made arrangements in advance with me, homework turned in after class will be considered late. When doing your homework, I encourage you to consult the [Elements of Style for Proofs]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/ElementsOfStyle.pdf). On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) Homework number.  You can find the list of assignments on the [homework page]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat526f22/homework/).  I reserve the right to modify the homework assignments as I see necessary.

Generally, the written homework assignments will be due on Mondays, but I will always tell you when a given homework assignment is due--so there should never be any confusion. Your homework will always be graded for completion and some subset of the problems will be graded for correctness. Problems that are graded for completeness will be worth 1 point.  Problems that are graded for correctness will either be worth 2 points or 4 points depending on the level of difficulty.  Generally, computational problems will be worth 2 points while problems requiring a formal proof will be worth 4 points.  Each 4-point problem is subject to the following rubric:

<center>
<table class="table table-striped">
	<thead>
	<tr>
		<th style="text-align: center;">Grade</th>
		<th>Criteria</th>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td style="text-align: center;">4</td>
		<td>This is correct and well-written mathematics!</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="text-align: center;">3</td>
		<td>This is a good piece of work, yet there are some mathematical errors or some writing errors that need addressing.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="text-align: center;">2</td>
		<td>There is some good intuition here, but there is at least one serious flaw. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="text-align: center;">1</td>
		<td>I don't understand this, but I see that you have worked on it; come see me!</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="text-align: center;">0</td>
		<td>I believe that you have not worked on this problem enough or you didn't submit any work.</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</center>

To compute your score on a given homework assignment, I will divide your total points by the total possible points to obtain a percent score. Each homework assignment has the same weight.  Your overall homework grade will be worth 35% of your final grade.

### Exams ###
Coming soon...

<!-- There will be two midterm exams and a cumulative final exam.  Exam 1 will be a written exam consisting of an in-class portion, and possibly a take-home portion.  Exam 1 is *tentatively* scheduled for **???** (week ???) and is worth 25% of your overall grade in the course. Exam 2 will be a 30-minute oral exam taken individually with me (via Zoom or in my office, depending on how the semester proceeds) sometime during the last two weeks of classes. Exam 2 will be worth 15% of your overall grade. The final exam will be on **Wednesday, April 28** at 7:30-9:30AM and is worth 25% of your overall grade. The final exam may or may not have a take-home portion.  If either of Exam 1 or the Final Exam have a take-home portion, you will have a few days to complete it. Make-up exams will only be given under extreme circumstances, as judged by me. In general, it will be best to communicate conflicts ahead of time. -->

### Attendance and Participation ###
Regular attendance is expected and is vital to success in this course, but you will not explicitly be graded on attendance.  Students can find more information about NAU's attendance policy on the [Academic Policies](https://in.nau.edu/dean-of-students/academic-policies/) page. You are also expected to respectfully participate and contribute to class discussions. This includes asking relevant and meaningful questions to both the instructor and your peers in class and on our Discord server.

<p>I must not fear.<br />
Fear is the mind-killer.<br />
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.<br />
I will face my fear.<br />
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.<br />
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.<br />
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.<br />
Only I will remain.</p>

</blockquote>

### Extra Credit ###
The only thing I will award extra credit for is finding typos on course materials (e.g., textbook, exams, syllabus, webpage).  This includes broken links on the webpage.  However, it does not include the placement of commas and such.  If you find a typo, I will add one percentage point to your next exam.  You can earn at most two percentage points per exam and at most five percentage points over the course of the semester. They're is a typo right here.

### Basis for Evaluation ###
In summary, your final grade will be determined by your scores in the following categories.

<center>
<table class="table table-striped">
	<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Category</th>
		<th style="text-align: center;">Weight</th>
		<th>Notes </th>
	</tr>

	<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>Homework</td>
		<td style="text-align: center;">35%</td>
		<td>See above for requirements</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Exam 1</td>
		<td style="text-align: center;">25%</td>
		<td>In-class portion on ???, possible take-home portion</td>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Exam 2</td>
    <td style="text-align: center;">15%</td>
    <td>Individual oral exam taken during last 2 weeks of semester</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Final Exam</td>
		<td style="text-align: center;">25%</td>
		<td>???</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>

<p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</p>

### Department and University Policies ###
You are responsible for knowing and following the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics Policies]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/DepartmentPoliciesFall2022.pdf) (PDF) and other University policies listed [here](https://nau.edu/university-policy-library/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/Syllabus-Policy-Statements.pdf) (PDF).  More policies can be found in other university documents, especially the [NAU Student Handbook](https://in.nau.edu/dean-of-students/Student-Handbook/) (see appendices) and the website of the [Student Outreach and Support](https://in.nau.edu/dean-of-students/nau-sos/) (SOS).

As per Department Policy, cell phones, MP3 players and portable electronic communication devices, including but not limited to smart phones, cameras and recording devices, must be turned off and inaccessible during in-class tests. Any violation of this policy will be treated as academic dishonesty.

### Important Dates ###
Here are some important dates:

- **September 5:** Labor Day (no classes)
- **September 8:** Last day to drop a course (without a "W")
- **September 10:** Department Picnic
- **October 28:** Last day to withdraw from a course (with a "W")
- **November 11:** Veteran's Day (no classes)
- **November 24-25:** Thanksgiving Holiday (no classes)
- **December 12:** Final Exam (10:00AM-12:00PM)

### Getting Help ###
There are many resources available to get help.  First, you are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework.  However, each student is expected to turn in their own work. You are strongly encouraged to ask questions in our Discord discussion group, as I (and hopefully other members of the class) will post comments there for all to benefit from.  You are also encouraged to stop by during my office hours and you can always [email me](mailto:dana.ernst@nau.edu).  I am always happy to help you.  If my office hours don't work for you, then we can probably find another time to meet.  It is your responsibility to be aware of how well you understand the material.  Don't wait until it is too late if you need help.  *Ask questions*!
