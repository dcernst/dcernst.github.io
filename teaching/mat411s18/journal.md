We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, January 15:</b> Martin Luther King Jr. Day, no classes.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, January 17:</b> First day! The first few minutes of class were devoted to me attempting to learn names. Next, I summarized what to expect from the course, toured the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411s18/">course webpage</a>, and summarized a few items on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411s18/syllabus/">syllabus</a>. With the time we had left, we briefly tinkered with Spinpossible.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, January 19:</b> I think we had a great second day! After fielding a few questions about the syllabus and reminding students about the day-to-day structure, we divided the class up into 10 small groups, each tasked with discussing one of the homework problems.  We had RF, RD, SJ, JB, VM, ER, and HH presented their proposed solutions to Problems 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, and 2.8, respectively. Along the way I presented a solution to Problem 2.6.  We will wrap up Problems 2.9, 2.10, and 2.11.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, January 22:</b> Another great day!

  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, January 24:</b> After a quick summary of what a group is, we jumped into student presentations.  We had TC, ER, JC, AM, JW, FA, and AT present Problems 2.20(a), 2.21(a), 2.22(a), 2.23(a), 2.24, 2.26(a), and 2.26(b), respectively.  Along the way, I discussed part (b) for 2.20-2.23. We discussed LaTeX briefly in the last few minutes of class.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, January 26:</b> We accomplished a lot today.  Most presenters were chosen in advance.  We had MM, ML, MS, AS, FZ, BH, and LD present Problem 2.27, Problem 2.28, Theorem 2.29, Problem 2.31, Problem 2.32, Problem 2.34, and Theorem 2.37, respectively.

We had JC, DS, RH, GT, DC, and JS present Theorem 2.43 (which as left over from Monday), Theorem 2.44, Theorem 2.45, Theorem 2.47(a), Theorem 2.47(b), and Problem 2.48, respectively. Theorem 2.50 and Problems 2.53-2.55 will likely get discussed on Friday when Dr. Falk covers for me.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, February 2:</b> Dr. Falk covered for me while I was out of town.  My understanding is that Dr. Falk covered Theorem 2.50, Problem 2.53, and Problem 2.54.
