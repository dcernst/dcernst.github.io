## Guidelines ##
On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) homework number. You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in their own work. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed to turn in **up to three late homework assignments with no questions asked**. Unless you have made arrangements in advance with me, homework turned in after class will be considered late. When doing your homework, I encourage you to consult the [Elements of Style for Proofs]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/ElementsOfStyle.pdf). See the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat431s20/syllabus/) for additional details.

## Daily Homework Assignments ##
The following assignments are due at the beginning of the indicated class meeting. However, most assignments will be collected at the end of the class meeting.  I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations.  Daily assignments will be graded on a $\checkmark$-system.  During class, **you are only allowed and encouraged to annotate your homework using the colored marker pens that I provide**.

## Weekly Homework ##
The purpose of the Weekly Homework will be to reflect on your work done in the Daily Homework and to ensure you understand how to do the problems on your second pass. Every few days, I will post solutions (likely using video) to a subset of the problems that were recently due. Your task will be to reflect on the work you previously did for the corresponding problems and to take notes on my proposed solutions. As with the Daily Homework, you will submit your work as a PDF to BbLearn. Each Weekly Homework assignment will be worth 4 points and your score will be based on the quality of the work that you submit.

- **Weekly Homework 1:** Using the solutions that I posted on BbLearn in the "Solutions" folder and the samples of student work that you've seen, reflect on the work you did for Daily Homeworks 23 and 24. To accomplish this, I suggest you do some combination of annotating your work and taking notes on the solutions I posted. Submit a digital copy (PDF) of your work in BbLearn.  (Due by 5pm on Thursday, April 2)
- **Weekly Homework 2:** Using the solutions that I posted on BbLearn in the "Solutions" folder and the samples of student work that you've seen, reflect on the work you did for Daily Homeworks 25-27. To accomplish this, I suggest you do some combination of annotating your work and taking notes on the solutions I posted. Submit a digital copy (PDF) of your work in BbLearn.  (Due by 5pm on Thursday, April 9)
- **Weekly Homework 3:** Write a reflection on all of the student work for 7.14, 7.15, 7.17, 7.18 that is posted under "Student Work" in BbLearn. In addition, using the solutions that I posted on BbLearn and the samples of student work that you've seen, reflect on the work you did for Daily Homeworks 28-30. To accomplish this, I suggest you do some combination of annotating your work and taking notes on my solutions. Submit a digital copy (PDF) of your work in BbLearn. (Due by 5pm on Monday, April 13)
- **Weekly Homework 4:** Using the solutions that I posted on BbLearn, reflect on the work you did for Daily Homeworks 31-35. To accomplish this, I suggest you do some combination of annotating your work and taking notes on my solutions. Submit a digital copy (PDF) of your work in BbLearn. (Due by 5pm on Friday, May 1)
