## Guidelines ##
On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) homework number. You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in his or her own work. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed to turn in **up to three late homework assignments with no questions asked**. Unless you have made arrangements in advance with me, homework turned in after class will be considered late. When doing your homework, I encourage you to consult the [Elements of Style for Proofs]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/ElementsOfStyle.pdf). See the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat431s20/syllabus/) for additional details.

## Daily Homework Assignments ##
The following assignments are due at the beginning of the indicated class meeting. However, most assignments will be collected at the end of the class meeting.  I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations.  Daily assignments will be graded on a $\checkmark$-system.  During class, **you are only allowed and encouraged to annotate your homework using the colored marker pens that I provide**.

- **Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat431s20/syllabus/) and write down 5 important items.  *Note:*  All of the exam dates only count as a single item.  Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class. (Due Wednesday, January 15)

I'm not sure we will have time to formally tackle 6.20 and 6.21, so we will just take them for granted.

In the interest of time, let's take 6.30 for granted (derivatives give slopes of tangent lines). In addition, write a reflection on all of the student work for 6.14, 6.16, 6.18, 6.19, 6.22 that is posted under "Student Work" in BbLearn. Submit a digital copy (PDF) of your work in BbLearn. (Due by 8pm on Monday, March 30)

## Weekly Homework ##
The purpose of the Weekly Homework will be to reflect on your work done in the Daily Homework and to ensure you understand how to do the problems on your second pass. Every few days, I will post solutions (likely using video) to a subset of the problems that were recently due. Your task will be to reflect on the work you previously did for the corresponding problems and to take notes on my proposed solutions. As with the Daily Homework, you will submit your work as a PDF to BbLearn. Each Weekly Homework assignment will be worth 4 points and your score will be based on the quality of the work that you submit.

- **Weekly Homework 1:** Coming soon. (Due by noon on Tuesday, March 31)
