## Guidelines ##
On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) homework number. You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in their own work. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed to turn in **up to three late homework assignments**. Unless you have made arrangements in advance with me, homework turned in after class will be considered late. When doing your homework, I encourage you to consult the [Elements of Style for Proofs]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/ElementsOfStyle.pdf).

Reviewing material from previous courses and looking up definitions and theorems you may have forgotten is fair game. However, when it comes to completing assignments for this course, you should *not* look to resources outside the context of this course for help.  That is, you should not be consulting the web, other texts, other faculty, or students outside of our course in an attempt to find solutions to the problems you are assigned.  This includes Chegg and Course Hero. On the other hand, you may use each other, the textbook, me, and your own intuition. **If you feel you need additional resources, please come talk to me and we will come up with an appropriate plan of action.** Please read NAU's [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www5.nau.edu/policies/Client/Details/828?whoIsLooking=Students&pertainsTo=All&sortDirection=Ascending&page=1).

## Daily Homework ##
The following assignments are due at the beginning of the indicated class meeting. However, most assignments will be collected at the end of the class meeting.  I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations.  During class, you are encouraged to annotate your homework, but **you are required to use a different color than what you used to complete your homework**.

- **Daily Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320f21/syllabus/) and write down 5 important items.  *Note:*  All of the exam dates only count as a single item.  Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class or email me a copy of your write up prior to class. (Due Wednesday, August 25)
- **Daily Homework 2:** Create a free [Discord](http://discord.com) account, accept the invite to our Discord server (see welcome message in email), and post something about yourself in the #introductions channel. (Due Wednesday, August 25 by 8PM)
- **Daily Homework 3:** Read the [Preface]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320f21/Preface.pdf) and [Introduction]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320f21/Introduction.pdf). In addition, complete 2.2-2.4 in [Chapter 2: Mathematics and Logic]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320f21/MathAndLogic.pdf) and digest the surrounding text along the way. (Due Wednesday, August 25)
- **Daily Homework 4:** Complete 2.6 and 2.7 in [Chapter 2: Mathematics and Logic]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320f21/MathAndLogic.pdf) and digest the surrounding text along the way. (Due Friday, August 27)
- **Daily Homework 5:** Complete 2.8-2.11 in [Chapter 2: Mathematics and Logic]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320f21/MathAndLogic.pdf) and digest the surrounding text along the way. (Due Monday, August 30)
- **Daily Homework 6:** Complete 2.12 in [Chapter 2: Mathematics and Logic]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320f21/MathAndLogic.pdf) and digest the surrounding text along the way. (Due Wednesday, September 1)

## Weekly Homework ##
For most of the assignments below, you will be required to submit 2-3 formally written proofs. You are required to type your submission using LaTeX (see below). You can either submit a hardcopy of your assignment or email me the PDF of your completed work. If you email me the PDF, please name your file as <code>WeeklyX-LastName.pdf</code>, where <code>X</code> is the number of the assignment and <code>LastName</code> is your last name.  Notice there are no spaces in the filename.

<!-- Submit your the PDF to the corresponding assignment on BbLearn. -->

- **Weekly Homework 1:** Watch "Grit: the power of passion and perseverance" and any other 4 videos listed under <b>Videos on Growth Mindset and Productive Failure</b> on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320f21/materials/">Course Materials</a> page and then write a reflection that is at least 15 sentences long. You should list the videos you watched. Rather than reflecting on each video separately, try to reflect on growth mindset, productive failure, and grit, in general. <b>You are required to type your reflection using LaTeX</b>. For this assignment, I suggest you use the template on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/weekly-homework-1-for-reflection-on-growth-mindset-and-productive-failure-foundations-of-mathematics/pxwcxqqrqmdv) (after clicking link, click on "Open as Template") instead of using the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below.  (Due Thursday, September 2 by 8PM)

<!-- - **Weekly Homework 2:** Prove **one** of 2.3, 2.4, 2.8, 2.14, 2.18, 2.22, 2.23. You must type up your proofs using LaTeX.  I suggest you use my Overleaf template, which you can access by clicking the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below. (Due Thursday, January 30 by 8PM)
- **Weekly Homework 3:** Prove **one** of 2.49-2.51. You must type up your proofs using LaTeX. In addition, read the Foreword, Preface, and any **two** stories (they aren't too long) from [Living Proof]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/LivingProof.pdf), and then type up responses to the following questions for each story.  Be sure to indicate which stories you read. Once again, use the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below. You'll need to delete one of the theorem/proof pairs to write your responses to the reflection questions. (Due Thursday, February 6 by 8PM)
    1. Did you identify with the author of the story? If so, in what way?
    2. How does the author's experience differ from your own?
    3. What surprised you about the author's story?
    4. Did this story make you think differently about mathematics? I'm expecting more than "yes/no".
    5. What about the story inspires and/or bothers you?
- **Weekly Homework 4:** Prove **two** of 2.49, 2.50, 2.61 (only need to prove in one way, your choice), 2.86. You must type up your proofs using LaTeX.  I suggest you use my Overleaf template, which you can access by clicking the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below. (Due Thursday, February 13 by 8PM)
- **Weekly Homework 5:** Prove **two** of 3.9, 3.18, 3.19(a), 3.19(b), 3.20(a), 3.20(b). You must type up your proofs using LaTeX.  I suggest you use my Overleaf template, which you can access by clicking the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below. (Due Sunday, February 23 by 8PM)
- **Weekly Homework 6:** Prove **two** of 3.26, 3.41(a), 3.41(b), 3.42(a), 3.42(b). You must type up your proofs using LaTeX.  I suggest you use my Overleaf template, which you can access by clicking the "Start your homework in Overleaf" link below. (Due Thursday, March 5 by 8PM) -->

## Using LaTeX for Weekly Homework ##
You are required to use LaTeX to type up your Weekly Homework assignments. The easiest way to get started with LaTeX is to use an online editor.  I recommend using [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com), but there are other options.  The good folks over at Overleaf have preloaded my homework template, so to get started, all you need to do is click the link below and then click on "Open as Template". Be sure to update your name and the course title.
