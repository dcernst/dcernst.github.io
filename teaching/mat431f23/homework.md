## Instructions ##
On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) homework number. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed to turn in **up to three late homework assignments**. Unless you have made arrangements in advance with me, homework turned in after class will be considered late. When doing your homework, I encourage you to consult the I encourage you to consult the "Elements of Style for Proofs" appendix in the textbook.

Reviewing material from previous courses and looking up definitions and theorems you may have forgotten is fair game. Since mathematical reasoning, problem solving, and critical thinking skills are part of the learning outcomes of this course, all assignments should be prepared by the student. Developing strong competencies in this area will prepare you to be a lifelong learner and give you an edge in a competitive workplace. When it comes to completing assignments for this course, unless explicitly told otherwise, you should *not* look to resources outside the context of this course for help.  That is, you should not be consulting the web (e.g., Chegg and Course Hero), generative artificial intelligence tools (e.g., ChatGPT), mathematics assistive technologies (e.g., Wolfram Alpha and Photomath), other texts, other faculty, or students outside of our course in an attempt to find solutions to the problems you are assigned.  On the other hand, you may use each other, the textbook, me, and your own intuition. You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework. Yet, each student is expected to turn in their own work.  **If you feel you need additional resources or support, please come talk to me and we will come up with an appropriate plan of action.**

## Assignments ##
The following assignments are due at the beginning of the indicated class meeting. However, most assignments will be collected at the end of the class meeting.  I reserve the right to modify an assignment if the need arises.  These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations.  During class, you are encouraged to annotate your homework, but **you are required to use a different color than what you used to complete your homework**.

- **Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat431f23/syllabus/) and write down 5 important items. *Note:*  All of the exam dates only count as a single item.  Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class or email me a copy of your write up prior to class. (Due Wednesday, August 30)
- **Homework 2:** Read the "Preface" and "Chapter 1: Introduction" of our textbook. The purpose of Chapter 2: Preliminaries" is to summarize most of the content from MAT 320 that we need to be familiar prior to starting something new. Read through this chapter and complete any 5 problems in Section 2.1, 1 problem in Section 2.2, and 5 problems in Section 2.3. I encourage you to try ones you aren't quite certain how to do in order to maximize your review. In addition, make a list of a few problems you are not sure how to complete. (Due Wednesday, August 30)
