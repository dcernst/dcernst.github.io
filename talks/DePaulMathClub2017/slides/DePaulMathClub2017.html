<h2>The Futurama Mind Swap Problem</h2>
<p>Here are the swaps that take place during the episode. We are indicating which bodies sat in machine.</p>
<ul>
<li class="slide">Professor ($p$) $\leftrightarrow$ Amy ($a$)</li>
<li class="slide">Amy ($a$) $\leftrightarrow$ Bender ($b$)</li>
<li class="slide">Professor ($p$) $\leftrightarrow$ Leela ($l$)</li>

<li class="slide">Emperor Nikolai ($e$) $\leftrightarrow$ Wash Bucket ($w$)</li>
<li class="slide">Hermes ($h$)$\leftrightarrow$ Leela ($l$)</li>
</ul>
<p class="slide">The upshot:
\[a \rightarrow h \rightarrow l \rightarrow p \rightarrow b \rightarrow e \rightarrow w \rightarrow a \text{ and } f \leftrightarrow z\]
</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>The Futurama Mind Swap Problem</h2>
<p>The question is: </p>
<blockquote class="slide">
<p>Can the machine be used to put everyone's mind back in the proper body if we are <a>not</a> allowed to use the machine on the same pair of bodies more than once?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="slide">We need to use math!</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>The Symmetric Group</h2>
<p class="slide">We can model this problem in terms of permutations (i.e., rearrangements) of numbers.  It turns out that the set of all permutations of the numbers 1 through $n$ forms a <a>group</a> under composition.</p>

<p class="slide">A <a>group</a> is a set with an associative binary operation satisfying:</p>
<ul>
<li class="slide"><h4>Closure</h4> The "product" of any two elements from the set is an element of the set.</li>
<li class="slide"><h4>Identity</h4> There exists a "do-nothing" element.</li>
<li class="slide"><h4>Inverses</h4> For every element in the set, there exists another element in the set that "undoes" the original.</li>
</ul>
<p class="slide">The group of permutations of $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$ is called the <a>symmetric group</a> and is denoted by $S_n$. <a>Note:</a> We will multiply right to left (like function composition).</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Permutation Diagrams</h2>
<p class="slide">One way of representing an element of the symmetric group is via <a>permutation diagrams</a>, which we illustrate with examples.</p>
<h3 class="slide">Example</h3>
<p class="slide"><img src="Diagram1.png" width="300" alt="Diagram1"></p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Permutation Diagrams</h2>
<p>Let's try multiplying.</p>
<h3 class="slide">Example</h3>
<p class="slide">Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be as on previous slide. Then</p>
<p class="slide">
<img src="Diagram2.png" width="500" alt="Diagram2"></p>
<p class="slide">But on the other hand</p>
<p class="slide">
<img src="Diagram3.png" width="500" alt="Diagram3"></p>

<p class="slide">We see that products of permutations do not necessarily commute (order matters).</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Permutation Diagrams</h2>
<p>However, sometimes permutations do commute.</p>
<h3 class="slide">Example</h3>
<p class="slide">Let $\beta$ and $\gamma$ be as before.  Then</p>
<p class="slide">
<img src="Diagram4.png" width="550" alt="Diagram4"></p>
<p class="slide">Notice that these result in the same diagram.  So, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ commute.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Comments</h2>
<ul>
<li class="slide">Order matters, but not always.</li>
<li class="slide">A permutation/diagram that swaps precisely two numbers is called a <a>transposition</a>.
<img src="Diagram5.png" width="250" alt="Diagram5"></li>
<li class="slide">"Disjoint" transpositions commute.</li>
<li class="slide">$S_n$ is generated by the transpositions.  That is, every permutation can be written as a product of some sequence of transpositions.  In fact, we only need the adjacent transpositions: $i$ swaps with $i+1$.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>The Futurama Mind Swap Problem as a Diagram</h2>
<p class="slide">If we let $a=1$, $h=2$, $l=3$, $p=4$, $b=5$, $e=6$, and $w=7$, $f=8$, and $z=9$, then the mind swaps from Futurama can be depicted as:</p>
<p class="slide">
<img src="Diagram7.png" width="650" alt="Diagram7">
</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Rephrasing the Problem</h2>
<p>The problem can be restated as:</p>
<blockquote class="slide">
<p>Suppose a permutation results from multiplying distinct transpositions.  Can we multiply this permutation by a sequence of transpositions that we have <a>not</a> yet used to obtain the identity permutation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="slide">It turns out that the answer is yes.  Keeler's trick to pulling this off is to utilize two additional people that have not sat in the machine.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>The Futurama Theorem</h2>
<p>Here is the solution presented in the show.</p>
<p>
<img src="FuturamaTheorem.png" width="750" alt="FuturamaTheorem"></p>
<p><a>Note:</a>This image is taken from <a href="http://theinfosphere.org/Futurama_theorem">The Infosphere: The Futurama Wiki</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Cycle Notation</h2>
<p class="slide">Before describing the solution, we need to introduce a more efficient way of encoding permutations.  One such method is called <a>cycle notation</a>.</p>
<h3 class="slide">Example</h3>
<p class="slide">
<img src="Diagram6.png" width="500" alt="Diagram6"></p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Cycle Notation</h2>
<p>Let's try multiplying using cycle notation. <a>Reminder:</a> We multiply right to left (like function composition).</p>
<h3 class="slide">Example</h3>
<p class="slide">Consider $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ in $S_{5}$ as in the previous examples. Then</p>
<p class="slide">\[\alpha \beta=(1\; 2\; 3\; 4\; 5)(2\; 4\; 3)=(1\; 2\; 5).\]</p>
<p class="slide">and</p>
<p class="slide">\[\gamma\beta =(2\; 4\; 3)(1\; 5)=(1\; 5)(2\; 4\; 3).\]</p>
<p class="slide">We saw earlier that $\beta$ and $\gamma$ commute with each other, which is why it looks like nothing happened in the second example.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>More Comments</h2>
<ul>
<li class="slide">In cycle notation, the Futurama permutation is $(8\; 9)(1\; 2\; 3\; 4\; 5\; 6\; 7)$.</li>
<li class="slide">The interpretation of a cycle $(\cdots\; i\; j\; \cdots)$ is that the body numbered $i$ passes its mind to the body numbered $j$, etc.</li>
<li class="slide">Transpositions are of the form $(i\; j)$, which means that $i$ and $j$ swap minds.</li>
<li class="slide">"Disjoint" cycles (including transpositions) commute.</li>
<li class="slide">If we can figure out how to "fix" one cycle at a time, then we can likely fix them all.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Fixing a Single 7-cycle</h2>
<p class="slide">Consider just the 7-cycle $(1\; 2\; 3\; 4\; 5\; 6\; 7)$.  Introduce two new bodies that have not had their minds swapped with anyone else, say $x$ and $y$.  To return all minds of 1-7 back to their rightful owner, multiply the cycle (on the left) by the following sequence of transpositions:</p>

<p class="slide">\[(x\; 7)(y\; 1)(y\; 2)(y\; 3)(y\; 4)(y\; 5)(y\; 6)(y\; 7)(x\; 1)\]</p>

<p class="slide">Let's verify that this actually works!  First, notice that all of these transpositions are distinct and since $x$ and $y$ are new, we never used any of the above transpositions to obtain our original scrambling of minds.</p>

<p class="slide">\[(x\; 7)(y\; 1)(y\; 2)(y\; 3)(y\; 4)(y\; 5)(y\; 6)(y\; 7)(x\; 1)(1\; 2\; 3\; 4\; 5\; 6\; 7)=???\]</p>

<p class="slide"><a>Note:</a> $x$ and $y$ now have their minds swapped with each other, but they never sat in the machine at the same time!</p>

</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Fixing an Arbitrary $k$-cycle</h2>
<p class="slide">Consider the $k$-cycle $(1\; 2\; \ldots\; k)$.  How do we "fix" this cycle?</p>

<p class="slide">As before, introduce two new bodies that have not used the machine, say $x$ and $y$.  To fix a $k$-cycle, multiply the cycle (on the left) by the following:</p>

<p class="slide">\[(x\; k)(y\; 1)(y\; 2)\cdots (y\; k-1)(y\; k)(x\; 1)\]</p>

<p class="slide">Why does this work?!</p>
<ul>
<li class="slide">First observation: $(y\; k)(x\; 1)(1\; 2\; \ldots\; k-1\; k)=(1\; 2\; \ldots\; k-1\; y\; k\; x)$.</li>
<li class="slide">Then $(y\; k-1)$ puts the mind of $k-1$ back where it belongs.</li>
<li class="slide">And then $(y\; k-2)$ puts the mind of $k-2$ back where it belongs.</li>
<li class="slide">We continue this way and in the second to last step, $(y\; 1)$ puts the mind of 1 back where it belongs.</li>
<li class="slide">And finally, we finish by swapping $x$ and $k$.</li>
<li class="slide">We now have $x$ and $y$ with their minds swapped (but they never sat in the machine at the same time).</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Fixing Products of Disjoint Cycles</h2>
<p>What do we do when we have multiple cycles to start with?</p>
<ul>
<li class="slide">Use $x$ and $y$ to fix each individual cycle.</li>
<li class="slide">When doing this, $x$ and $y$ will sometimes have their minds swapped (but they never sat in machine at same time).</li>
<li class="slide">If the number of disjoint cycles is even, then we are done after we fix each individual cycle.</li>
<li class="slide">If the number of disjoint cycles is odd, then after fixing each individual cycle, finish by having $x$ and $y$ sit in the machine at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Observations and Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li class="slide"><a>Fun Problem:</a> Which permutations in $S_n$ can we obtain by multiplying distinct transpositions? That is, what configurations of mind swaps are possible with $n$ people?</li>
<li class="slide">Regardless of what the answer to the previous problem is, notice that the Futurama Theorem doesn't care how the permutation arose.</li>
<li class="slide">In general, if $\sigma\in S_n$ consisting of $r$ disjoint cycles, then Keeler's algorithm requires $n+2r+1$ or $n+2r$ moves depending on whether $r$ is odd or even, respectively.</li>
<li class="slide">Can we do better (i.e., fewer moves to fix the cycles)?</li>
<li class="slide">Applying our algorithm to the arrangement of minds in Futurama requires 13 moves.</li>
<li class="slide">But since Fry and Zoidberg only swapped with each other and since there is only one other cycle, we could use Fry and Zoidberg as $x$ and $y$, respectively in our algorithm.  This only requires 9 moves.</li>
<li class="slide">Under what circumstances do we not need to introduce two "clean" people?</li>
<li class="slide">Evans and Huang address questions related to optimality in <a>Mind Switches in Futurama and Stargate</a> (Mathematics Magazine 2014).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Two special cases</h2>
<p class="slide">Evans, Huang, and Nguyen also proved the following special cases involving the cycle $(1\; 2\; \dots n)$.</p>
<h3 class="slide">Theorem</h3>
<p class="slide">For $n\geq 5$, let $p=(1\; 2)(2\; 3)\cdots (n-1\; n)$.  Then  $\sigma=(3\; n)(2\; n-1)(1\; n)(1\; 4)(2\; n)(1\; 3)\cdot (3\; 5)\cdots (3\; n-1)$ is a product of $n+1$ distinct transpositions from $S_n$ that fixes $p$. (No new bodies required.) </p>

<h3 class="slide">Theorem</h3>
<p class="slide">For $n\geq 3$, let $p=(n\; n-1)\cdots (n\; 2)(n\; 1)$.  Then  $\tau=(2\; n+1)(3\; n+1)(4\; n+1)\cdots (n\; n+1)\cdot (1\; 2)(1\; n+1)$ is a product of $n+1$ distinct transpositions from $S_{n+1}$ that fixes $p$. (Only one new body required.)</p>

<h2>Stargate</h2>
<ul>
<li class="slide"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate" target="_blank">Stargate</a> is an adventure military science fiction franchise. The first film was released in October 1994.</li>
<li class="slide">The movies and TV shoes focus on "stargates", which are circular devices that create wormholes, enabling instantaneous transportation to another stargate located many light years away from the starting point.</li>
<li class="slide"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1" target="_blank">Stargate SG-1</a> is a television show based on the 1994 film. The series ran from 1997 to 2007.</li>
<!-- <li class="slide">With 214 episodes over 10 seasons, Stargate SG-1 had surpassed The X-Files as the longest-running North American science fiction television series, a record later broken by Smallville.</li>

<h2>The Stargate Switch Problem</h2>
<p>Here are the swaps that take place during the episode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ma'chello $\leftrightarrow$ Daniel</li>
<li>Jack $\leftrightarrow$ Teal'c</li>
</ul>

<p>The question is: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can the machine be used to put everyone's mind back in the proper body if we are <a>not</a> allowed to use the machine on the same pair of bodies more than once?</p>
</blockquote>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>The Generalized Stargate Switch</h2>
<ul>
<li class="slide">Suppose we have $m$ pairs of bodies, where each pair swaps minds.</li>
<li class="slide">Can the machine be used to put everyone's mind back in the proper body if we are <a>not</a> allowed to use the machine on the same pair of bodies more than once?</li>
<li class="slide">This is a special case of the problem posed in Futurama. So, we know this is solvable.</li>
<li class="slide">However, do we need to introduce outsiders to solve the problem? Also, what is the minimal number of "moves" required to put everyone's mind back where it belongs?</li>
<li class="slide">In cycle notation, the original Stargate Switch permutation can be written as
\[\sigma=(1\; 2)(3\; 4),\]
where 1 is Ma'chello, 2 is Daniel, 3 is Jack, and 4 is Teal'c.</li>
<li class="slide">The Generalized Stargate Switch permutation is of the form
\[\sigma=(1\; 2)(3\; 4)\cdots (2m-1\; 2m).\]</li>
<li class="slide">To solve the problem, we must produce a permutation $\mu$ consisting of distinct transpositions, none equaling a factor of $\sigma$, such that the product $\mu\sigma$ is the identity in $S_{2m}$.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Solution to Original Stargate Switch</h2>
<!-- <p class="slide">Evans and Huang from the University of California, San Diego recently proved the following theorem. [<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6086" target="_blank">arXiv</a>]</p>
<h3 class="slide">Theorem</h3> -->
<p class="slide">The following permutation solves the original Stargate Switch Problem.</p>
<p class="slide">\[\mu=(2\; 4)(1\; 3)(2\; 3)(1\; 4)\]</p>
<p class="slide">Moreover, this solution is optimal in the sense that no solution with fewer than 4 moves will work.</p>

<h3 class="slide">Proof</h3>
<p class="slide">First, easy to check that $\mu\sigma$ yields the identity:</p>
<p class="slide">\[\mu\sigma=(2\; 4)(1\; 3)(2\; 3)(1\; 4)\circ (1\; 2)(3\; 4)=\text{identity permutation}\]</p>
<p class="slide">Why is $\mu$ optimal?  Well, it's easy to check that 2 transpositions (not reusing the originals and only using $1,2,3,4$) won't work.  The reason why $\mu$ cannot only have 3 cycles is because of a general fact that says that the identity permutation cannot be equal to a product of an odd number of transpositions.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Solution to Generalized Stargate Switch</h2>
<p>Evans and Huang also proved the following more general theorem.</p>
<h3>Theorem</h3>
<p>Let $m>1$.  Then the Generalized Stargate Switch permutation</p>
<p>\[\sigma=(1\; 2)(3\; 4)\cdots (2m-1\; 2m)\]</p>
<p>can be undone by a product $\mu$ of $N(m)$ distinct transpositions, where for $j=4i$</p>
<p>\[\mu=\begin{cases}\tau \prod_{i=2}^{(m-1)/2} (j\; j+2)(j-1\; j+1)(j\; j+1)(j-1\; j+2), & \text{if }m\text{ is odd}\\
\prod_{i=1}^{m/2}(j-1\; j)(j-3\; j-1)(j-2\; j-1)(j-3\; j), & \text{if }m\text{ is even}\end{cases}\]</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>\[\tau=(1\; 3)(1\; 6)(4\; 5)(4\; 6)(3\; 5)(2\; 5)(1\; 5).\]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>\[N(m)=\begin{cases}2m+1, & \text{if }m\text{ is odd (and greater than 1),}\\
2m, & \text{if }m\text{ is even.}\end{cases}\]</p>
<p>The empty product for $m=3$ is interpreted as the identity permutation. Moreover, $N(m)$ is optimal.</p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
<h2>Examples of Solutions</h2>
<p>The previous formula looks pretty scary, but it's not too bad.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>When $m=3$, we have</p>
<p>\[\mu= \tau=(1\; 3)(1\; 6)(4\; 5)(4\; 6)(3\; 5)(2\; 5)(1\; 5),\]</p>
<p>which consists of $N(3)=7$ transpositions.</p>

<p>When $m=4$, we have</p>
<p>\[\mu=(2\; 4)(1\; 3)(2\; 3)(1\; 4)(6\; 8)(5\; 7)(6\; 7)(5\; 8),\]</p>
<p>which consists of $N(4)=8$ transpositions.
