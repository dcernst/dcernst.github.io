<div class="para">When proving the previous theorem, you likely experienced some dèjá vu. You should have assumed “<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is even or <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is even” at some point in your proof. The first case is “<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is even” while the second case is “<span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is even.” (Note that you do not need to handle the case when both <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> are even since the two individual cases already yield the desired result.) The proofs for both cases are identical except the roles of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> are interchanged. In instances such as this, mathematicians have a shortcut. Instead of writing two essentially identical proofs for each case, you can simply handle one of the cases and indicate that the remaining case follows from a nearly identical proof. The quickest way to do this is to use the phrase, “Without loss of generality, assume…”. For example, here is a proof of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_nm_odd_implies_n_or_m_odd.html" title="Theorem 2.89">Theorem 2.89</a> that utilizes this approach.</div>
