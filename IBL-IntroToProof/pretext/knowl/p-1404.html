<div class="para">The function diagram for <span class="process-math">\(\varphi\)</span> is given in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_passengers.html" title="Figure 8.49.(a)">Figure 8.49.(a)</a>, where we have highlighted the elements of the domain that map to the same element in the range by enclosing them in additional boxes. We see that <span class="process-math">\(\range(\varphi)=\{1,2,4\}\text{.}\)</span> The function diagram for the induced map <span class="process-math">\(\overline{\varphi}\)</span> that is depicted in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_airplanes.html" title="Figure 8.49.(b)">Figure 8.49.(b)</a> makes it clear that <span class="process-math">\(\overline{\varphi}\)</span> is a bijection. Note that since <span class="process-math">\(\varphi(a)=\varphi(b)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\varphi(d)=\varphi(e)=\varphi(f)\text{,}\)</span> it must be the case that <span class="process-math">\([a]=[b]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([d]=[e]=[f]\)</span> according to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_related_if_and_only_if_same_class.html" title="Theorem 7.45">Theorem 7.45</a>. Thus, the vertices labeled as <span class="process-math">\([a]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([d]\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_airplanes.html" title="Figure 8.49.(b)">Figure 8.49.(b)</a> could have also been labeled as <span class="process-math">\([b]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([c]\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\([d]\text{,}\)</span> respectively. In terms of our passengers and airplanes analogy, <span class="process-math">\(X=\{a,b,c,d,e,f\}\)</span> is the set of passengers, <span class="process-math">\(Y=\{1,2,3,4,5\}\)</span> is the set of potential destination cities, <span class="process-math">\(X/\mathord\sim=\{[a],[c],[d]\}\)</span> is the set of airplanes, and <span class="process-math">\(\range(\varphi)=\{1,2,4\}\)</span> is the set of cities that airplanes land at. The equivalence class <span class="process-math">\([a]\)</span> is the airplane containing the passenger <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are on the same plane, <span class="process-math">\([b]\)</span> is also the plane containing the passenger <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span>
