<div class="para">In this section, we will introduce the notions of open, closed, compact, and connected as they pertain to subsets of the real numbers. These properties form the underpinnings of a branch of mathematics called <em class="emphasis">topology</em> (derived from the Greek words <em class="emphasis">tópos</em>, meaning ‘place, location’, and <em class="emphasis">ology</em>, meaning ‘study of’). Topology, sometimes called “rubber sheet geometry,” is concerned with properties of spaces that are invariant under any continuous deformation (e.g., bending, twisting, and stretching like rubber while not allowing tearing apart or gluing together). The fundamental concepts in topology are continuity, compactness, and connectedness, which rely on ideas such as “arbitrary close” and “far apart”. These ideas can be made precise using open sets.</div>
