<div class="para">The previous characterization of continuity is often referred to as the “open set definition of continuity,” although for us it is a theorem instead of a definition. This is the definition used in topology. Another notion of continuity, called “sequential continuity”, makes use of convergent sequences. All of these characterizations of continuity are equivalent for the real numbers (using the standard definition of an open set). However, there are contexts in mathematics where the epsilon-delta definition of continuity is undefined (because there is not a notion of distance in either the domain or codomain) and others where continuity and sequential continuity are not equivalent.</div>
