<div class="para">Oftentimes a conditional proposition can be proved via a direct proof and by using a proof by contradiction. Most mathematicians view a direct proof to be more elegant than a proof by contradiction. When approaching the proof of a conditional proposition, you should strive for a direct proof. In general, if you are attempting to prove <span class="process-math">\(A\implies B\)</span> using a proof by contradiction and you end up with <span class="process-math">\(\neg B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> (which yields a contradiction), then this is evidence that a proof by contradiction was unnecessary. On the other hand, if you end up with <span class="process-math">\(\neg Q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is not the same as <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> then a proof by contradiction is a reasonable approach.</div>
