<div class="para">It is worth pointing out an important distinction. Consider the propositions “All cars are red” and “All natural numbers are positive”. Both of these are instances of the <dfn class="terminology">logical form</dfn> <span class="process-math">\((\forall x)P(x)\text{.}\)</span> It turns out that the first proposition is false and the second is true; however, it does not make sense to attach a truth value to the logical form. A logical form is a blueprint for particular propositions. If we are careful, it makes sense to talk about whether two logical forms are logically equivalent. For example, <span class="process-math">\((\forall x)(P(x)\implies Q(x))\)</span> is logically equivalent to <span class="process-math">\((\forall x)(\neg Q(x)\implies \neg P(x))\)</span> since a conditional proposition is logically equivalent to its contrapositive (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_contrapos.html" title="Theorem 2.39">Theorem 2.39</a>). For fixed <span class="process-math">\(P(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q(x)\text{,}\)</span> these two forms will always have the same truth value independent of the universe of discourse. If you change <span class="process-math">\(P(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q(x)\text{,}\)</span> then the truth value may change, but the two forms will still agree.</div>
