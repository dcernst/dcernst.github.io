<div class="para">The first draft of this book was written in 2009. At that time, several of the sections were adaptations of course materials written by Matthew Jones (CSU Dominguez Hills) and Stan Yoshinobu (University of Toronto). The current version of the book is the result of many iterations that involved the addition of new material, retooling of existing sections, and feedback from instructors that have used the book. The current version of the book is a far cry from what it looked like in 2009.</div>
