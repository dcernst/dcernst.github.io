<div class="para">The previous problem verifies that there exists a proper subset of the natural numbers that is in bijection with the natural numbers themselves. We also witnessed this in Parts (a) and (b) of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prob_someInfiniteSets.html" title="Problem 9.30">Problem 9.30</a>. Notice that <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_cardinalityProperSubsetsFinite.html" title="Theorem 9.24">Theorem 9.24</a> forbids this type of behavior for finite sets. It turns out that this phenomenon is true for all infinite sets. The next theorem verifies that that the two viewpoints of infinite sets discussed above are valid. To prove this theorem, we need to prove that the three statements are equivalent. One possible approach is to prove (i) if and only if (ii) and (ii) if and only if (iii). For (i) implies (ii), construct <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> recursively. For (ii) implies (i), try a proof by contradiction. For (ii) implies (iii), let <span class="process-math">\(B=A\setminus \{f(1),f(2),\ldots\}\)</span> and show that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> can be put in bijection with <span class="process-math">\(B\cup\{f(2),f(3),\ldots\}\text{.}\)</span> Lastly, for (iii) implies (ii), suppose <span class="process-math">\(g:A\to C\)</span> is a bijection for some proper subset <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(a\in A\setminus C\text{.}\)</span> Define <span class="process-math">\(f:\mathbb{N}\to A\)</span> via <span class="process-math">\(f(n)=g^n(a)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(g^n\)</span> means compose <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> with itself <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> times.</div>
