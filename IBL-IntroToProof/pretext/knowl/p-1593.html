<div class="para">But what if the sets are infinite? For example, consider the set of natural numbers <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and the set of even natural numbers <span class="process-math">\(2\mathbb{N}\coloneqq \{2n\mid n\in \mathbb{N}\}\text{.}\)</span> Clearly, <span class="process-math">\(2\mathbb{N}\)</span> is a proper subset of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{N}\text{.}\)</span> Moreover, both sets are infinite. In this case, you might be thinking that <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> is “larger than” <span class="process-math">\(2\mathbb{N}\text{.}\)</span> However, it turns out that there is a one-to-one correspondence between these two sets. In particular, consider the function <span class="process-math">\(f:\mathbb{N}\to 2\mathbb{N}\)</span> defined via <span class="process-math">\(f(n)=2n\text{.}\)</span> It is easily verified that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is both injective and surjective. In this case, mathematics has determined that the right viewpoint is that <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2\mathbb{N}\)</span> do have the same “size”. However, it is clear that “size” is a bit too imprecise when it comes to infinite sets. We need something more rigorous.</div>
