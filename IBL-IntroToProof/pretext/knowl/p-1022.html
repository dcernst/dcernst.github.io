<div class="para">There are a few interesting observations to make about Euclid’s proposition and his proof. First, notice that the statement of the theorem does not contain the word “infinity.” The Greek’s were skittish about the idea of infinity. Thus, he proved that there were more primes than any given finite number. Today we would say that there are infinitely many. In fact, Euclid proved that there are more than <em class="emphasis">three</em> primes and concluded that there were more than any finite number. While such a proof is not considered valid in the modern era, we can forgive Euclid for this less-than-rigorous proof; in fact, it is easy to turn his proof into the general one that you will give below. Lastly, Euclid’s proof was geometric. He was viewing his numbers as line segments with integral length. The modern concept of number was not developed yet.</div>
