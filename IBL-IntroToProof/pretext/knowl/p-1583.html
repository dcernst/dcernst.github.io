<div class="para">Perhaps you noticed the absence of one natural question in the previous sequence of problems. If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a continuous real function and <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> is a subset of the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> is the image <span class="process-math">\(f(K)\)</span> a compact set? It turns out that the answer is “yes”, but proving this fact is beyond the scope of this book. This theorem is often proved in a real analysis course and is then used to prove the Extreme Value Theorem, which you may have encountered in your calculus course.</div>
