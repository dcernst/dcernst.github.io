<div class="para">To handle the first case, use induction together with <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_union_of_countable_sets.html" title="Theorem 9.46">Theorem 9.46</a>. The second case is substantially more challenging. First, use <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_retool_infinite_collection.html" title="Theorem 9.47">Theorem 9.47</a> to construct a collection <span class="process-math">\(\{B_n\}\)</span> of pairwise disjoint sets whose union is equal to the union of the original collection. Since each <span class="process-math">\(B_n\)</span> is a subset of one of the sets in the original collection and each of these sets is countable, each <span class="process-math">\(B_n\)</span> is also countable by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_subsetsCountableSets.html" title="Theorem 9.42">Theorem 9.42</a>. This implies that for each <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> we can write <span class="process-math">\(B_n=\{b_{n,1}, b_{n,2},b_{n,3},\ldots\}\text{,}\)</span> where the set may be finite or infinite. From here, we outline two different approaches for continuing. One approach is to construct a bijection from <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}B_n\)</span> using <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_zig_zag.html" title="Figure 9.48">Figure 9.48</a> as inspiration. One thing you will need to address is what to do when a set in the collection <span class="process-math">\(\{B_n\}\)</span> is finite. For the second approach, define <span class="process-math">\(f:\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}B_n\to \mathbb{N}\)</span> via <span class="process-math">\(f(b_{n,m})=2^n3^m\text{,}\)</span> verify that this function is injective, and then appeal to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_subsetsCountableSets.html" title="Theorem 9.42">Theorem 9.42</a>. Try using both of these approaches when tackling the proof of the following theorem.</div>
