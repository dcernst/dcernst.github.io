<div class="para">Alright, we are finally ready to tackle the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Let <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> be a natural number greater than 1. By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_prodprimes.html" title="Theorem 6.6">Theorem 6.6</a>, we know that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> can be expressed as a product of primes. All that remains is to prove that this product is unique (up to the order in which they appear). For sake of a contradiction, suppose <span class="process-math">\(p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(q_1 q_2 \cdots q_l\)</span> are both prime factorizations of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Your goal is to prove that <span class="process-math">\(k=l\)</span> and that each <span class="process-math">\(p_i\)</span> is equal to some <span class="process-math">\(q_j\text{.}\)</span> Make repeated use of Euclid’s Lemma.</div>
