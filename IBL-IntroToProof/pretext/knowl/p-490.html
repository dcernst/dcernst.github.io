<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prob_barber.html" title="Problem 3.24">Problem 3.24</a> is an example of a <dfn class="terminology">paradox</dfn>. A paradox is a statement that can be shown, using a given set of axioms and definitions, to be both true and false. Recall that an axiom is a statement that is assumed to be true without proof. These are the basic building blocks from which all theorems are proved. Paradoxes are often used to show the inconsistencies in a flawed axiomatic theory. The term paradox is also used informally to describe a surprising or counterintuitive result that follows from a given set of rules. Now, suppose that there is a set of all sets and call it <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{U}\text{.}\)</span> That is, <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{U}\coloneqq \{A\mid A\mbox{ is a set} \}\text{.}\)</span>
