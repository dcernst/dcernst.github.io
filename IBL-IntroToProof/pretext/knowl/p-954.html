<div class="para">In other words, a set is disconnected if it can be partitioned into two nonempty subsets such that each subset does not contain points of the other and does not contain any accumulation points of the other. Showing that a set is disconnected is generally easier than showing a set is connected. To prove that a set is disconnected, you simply need to exhibit two open sets with the necessary properties. However, to prove that a set is connected, you need to prove that no such pair of open sets exists.</div>
