<em class="emphasis">Use a symbol to mean only one thing.</em> Once you use the letter <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> once, its meaning is fixed for the duration of your proof. You cannot use <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to mean anything else. There is an exception to this guideline. Sometimes a proof will include multiple subproofs that are distinct from each other. In this case, you can reuse a variable or symbol as long as it is clear to the reader that you have concluded with the previous subproof and have moved onto a new subproof.</div>
