<em class="emphasis">Do not utilize anything unproven.</em> Every statement in your proof should be something you <em class="emphasis">know</em> to be true. The reader expects your proof to be a series of statements, each proven by the statements that came before it. If you ever need to write something you do not yet know is true, you <em class="emphasis">must</em> preface it with words like “assume,” “suppose,” or “if” if you are temporarily assuming it, or with words like “we need to show that” or “we claim that” if it is your goal. Otherwise, the reader will think they have missed part of your proof.</div>
