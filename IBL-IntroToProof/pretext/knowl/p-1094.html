<div class="para">Below, we provide skeleton proofs for proving that a relation is reflexive, symmetric, or transitive. Notice that the skeleton proof for proving that a relation is reflexive is a special case of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/skeleton_for_all.html" title="Skeleton Proof 2.81: Direct Proof of (\forall x)P(x)">Skeleton Proof 2.81</a>. Similarly, the skeleton proofs involving symmetric and transitive are both special cases of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/skeleton_for_all_direct_proof.html" title="Skeleton Proof 2.82: Proof of (\forall x)(A(x)\implies B(x))">Skeleton Proof 2.82</a>. It is important to point out that every relation on the empty set is vacuously reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. In the skeleton proofs below, we are implicitly assuming that the set in question is nonempty. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to mention the possibility of the empty set.</div>
