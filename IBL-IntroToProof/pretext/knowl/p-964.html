<div class="para">The goal of this section is to prove The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (sometimes called the Unique Factorization Theorem) states that every natural number greater than 1 is either prime or is the product of prime numbers, where this product is unique up to the order of the factors. For example, the natural number 12 has prime factorization <span class="process-math">\(2^2\cdot 3\text{,}\)</span> where the order in which we write the prime factors (i.e., 2, 2, and 3) is irrelevant. That is, <span class="process-math">\(2^2\cdot 3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(2\cdot 3\cdot2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(3\cdot 2^2\)</span> are all the same prime factorization of 12. The requirement that the factors be prime is necessary since factorizations containing composite numbers may not be unique. For example, <span class="process-math">\(12=2\cdot 6\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(12=3\cdot 4\text{,}\)</span> but these factorizations into composite numbers are distinct. We have just thrown around a few fancy terms; we should make sure we understand their precise meaning.</div>
