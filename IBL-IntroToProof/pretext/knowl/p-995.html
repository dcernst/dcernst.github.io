<div class="para">The next result is a special case of a theorem known as Bézout’s Lemma (or Bézout’s Identity). Ultimately, we will need this theorem to prove Euclid’s Lemma (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Euclid.html" title="Theorem 6.15: Euclid’s Lemma">Theorem 6.15</a>), which we then use to prove uniqueness for the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_FTA.html" title="Theorem 6.17: Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic">Theorem 6.17</a>). To prove our special case of Bézout’s Lemma, consider the set <span class="process-math">\(S\coloneqq \{ps+at&gt; 0\mid s,t\in \mathbb{Z}\}\text{.}\)</span> First, observe that <span class="process-math">\(p\in S\)</span> (choose <span class="process-math">\(s=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t=0\)</span>). It follows that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is nonempty. By the Well-Ordering Principle (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_WOP.html" title="Theorem 4.39: Well-Ordering Principle">Theorem 4.39</a>), <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> contains a least element, say <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span> This implies that there exists <span class="process-math">\(s_1,t_1\in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(d=ps_1+at_1\text{.}\)</span> Our goal is to show that <span class="process-math">\(d=1\text{.}\)</span> Now, choose <span class="process-math">\(m\in S\text{.}\)</span> Then there exists <span class="process-math">\(s_2,t_2\in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(m=ps_2+at_2\text{.}\)</span> By the definition of <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(d\leq m\text{.}\)</span> By the Division Algorithm, there exists unique <span class="process-math">\(q,r\in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(m=qd+r\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(0\leq r \lt d\text{.}\)</span> Now, solve for <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> and then replace <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(ps_1+at_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(ps_2+at_2\text{,}\)</span> respectively. You should end up with an expression for <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> involving <span class="process-math">\(p,
a, s_1, s_2, t_1\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t_2\text{.}\)</span> Next, rearrange this expression to obtain <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> as a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> (i.e., a sum of a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>). What does the minimality of <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> imply about <span class="process-math">\(r\text{?}\)</span> You should be able to conclude that <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span> That is, every element of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span> However, recall that <span class="process-math">\(p\in S\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is prime, and <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> are relatively prime. What can you conclude about <span class="process-math">\(d\text{?}\)</span>
