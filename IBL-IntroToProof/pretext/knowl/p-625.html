<div class="para">At the end of <a href="sec_RussellsParadox.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.2: Russell’s Paradox">Section 3.2</a>, we briefly discussed ZFC, which is the standard choice for axiomatic set theory. It turns out that one can prove the Axiom of Induction as a theorem in ZFC. However, that will not be the approach we take. Instead, we are assuming the Axiom of Induction is true. Using this axiom, we can prove the following theorem, known as the <dfn class="terminology">Principle of Mathematical Induction</dfn>. One approach to proving this theorem is to let <span class="process-math">\(S=\{k\in \mathbb{N}\mid P(k) \text{ is true } \}\)</span> and use the Axiom of Induction. The set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is sometimes called the <dfn class="terminology">truth set</dfn>. Your job is to show that the truth set is all of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{N}\text{.}\)</span>
