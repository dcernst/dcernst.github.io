<div class="para">We can think of the set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> as a ladder, where the first hypothesis as saying that we have a first rung of a ladder. The second hypothesis says that if we are on any arbitrary rung of the ladder, then we can always get to the next rung. Taken together, this says that we can get from the first rung to the second, from the second to the third, and in general, from any <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>th rung to the <span class="process-math">\((k+1)\)</span>st rung, so that our ladder is actually <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{N}\text{.}\)</span> Do you agree that the Axiom of Induction is a pretty reasonable assumption?</div>
