<div class="para">In the language of abstract algebra, Axioms F1–F4 and F5–F8 make each of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}\)</span> an abelian group under addition and multiplication, respectively. Axiom F9 provides a way for the operations of addition and multiplication to interact. Collectively, Axioms F1–F9 make the real numbers a <dfn class="terminology">field</dfn>. Axioms F3 and F7 state the existence of additive and multiplicative identities, but these axioms do not assume that the elements are the unique elements with the specified properties. However, we can prove that this is the case. That is, <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> are the unique <dfn class="terminology">additive</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">multiplicative identities</dfn> in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\text{.}\)</span> To prove the following theorem, suppose <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(0'\)</span> are both additive identities in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> and then show that <span class="process-math">\(0=0'\text{.}\)</span> This shows that there can only be one additive identity. It is important to point out that we are not proving that the number <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> introduced in Axiom F3 is unique, but rather there is a unique number with the property specified in Axiom F3.</div>
