<div class="para">Suppose that we want to prove some proposition <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> (which might be something like <span class="process-math">\(A\implies B\)</span> or even more complicated). One approach, called <em class="emphasis">proof by contradiction</em>, is to assume <span class="process-math">\(\neg P\)</span> and then logically deduce a contradiction of the form <span class="process-math">\(Q\wedge \neg Q\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is some proposition. Since this is absurd, the assumption <span class="process-math">\(\neg P\)</span> must have been false, so <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true. The tricky part about a proof by contradiction is that it is not usually obvious what the statement <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> should be.</div>
