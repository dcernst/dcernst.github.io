<div class="para">According to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_R_uncountable.html" title="Theorem 9.58">Theorem 9.58</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/cor_power_set_of_N_uncountable.html" title="Corollary 9.65">Corollary 9.65</a>, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\)</span> are both uncountable. In fact, <span class="process-math">\(\card(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}))=\card(\mathbb{R})\text{,}\)</span> which we state without proof. However, it turns out that the two uncountable sets may or may not have the same cardinality. Perhaps surprisingly, there are sets that are even “bigger” than the set of real numbers. The next theorem is named after Georg Cantor, who first stated and proved it at the end of the 19th century. The theorem states that given any set, we can always increase the cardinality by considering its power set. That is, if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a set, <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P}(A)\)</span> has strictly greater cardinality than <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> itself. For finite sets, Cantor’s theorem follows from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_size_of_power_set_for_finite_sets.html" title="Theorem 4.12">Theorems 4.12</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_n_2_n.html" title="Theorem 4.13">Theorem 4.13</a> (both of which we proved via induction). Perhaps much more surprising is that Cantor discovered an elegant argument that is applicable to any set, whether finite or infinite. To prove Cantor’s Theorem, first exhibit an injective function from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{P}(A)\text{.}\)</span> This proves that <span class="process-math">\(\card(A)\leq \card(\mathcal{P}(A))\text{.}\)</span> To show that <span class="process-math">\(\card(A)\lt \card(\mathcal{P}(A))\text{,}\)</span> try a proof by contradiction. That is, assume there exists a bijective function <span class="process-math">\(f:A\to\mathcal{P}(A))\text{.}\)</span> Derive a contradiction by considering the set <span class="process-math">\(B=\{x\in A\mid x\notin f(x)\}\text{.}\)</span>
