<div class="para">The next result makes up half of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. We provide a substantial hint for its proof. Let <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> be the set of natural numbers for which the theorem fails. For sake of a contradiction, assume <span class="process-math">\(S\neq \emptyset\text{.}\)</span> By the Well-Ordering Principle (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_WOP.html" title="Theorem 4.36: Well-Ordering Principle">Theorem 4.36</a>), <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> contains a least element, say <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cannot be prime since this would satisfy the theorem. So, it must be the case that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> has a divisor other than 1 and itself. This implies that there exists natural numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> greater than 1 such that <span class="process-math">\(n=ab\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> was our smallest counterexample, what can you conclude about both <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{?}\)</span> Use this information to derive a contradiction for <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>
