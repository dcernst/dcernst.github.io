<em class="emphasis">Berry Paradox.</em> Consider the claim: every natural number can be unambiguously described in fourteen words or less. It seems clear that this statement is false, but if that is so, then there is some smallest natural number which cannot be unambiguously described in fourteen words or less. Let’s call it <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> But now <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is “the smallest natural number that cannot be unambiguously described in fourteen words or less.” This is a complete and unambiguous description of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> in fourteen words, contradicting the fact that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> was supposed not to have such a description. Therefore, all natural numbers can be unambiguously described in fourteen words or less!</div>
