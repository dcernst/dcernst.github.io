<div class="para">Recall that cardinality provides a way for talking about “how big” a set is. The fact that the natural numbers and the real numbers have different cardinality (one countable, the other uncountable), tells us that there are at least two different “sizes of infinity”. By iteratively taking the power set of an infinite set and applying Cantor’s Theorem we obtain an endless hierarchy of cardinalities, each strictly larger than the one before it. Colloquially, this implies that there are “infinitely many sizes of infinity” and there is “no largest infinity”.</div>
