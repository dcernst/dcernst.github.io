<div class="para">The penultimate theorem of this chapter is known as the <em class="emphasis">Well-Ordering Principle</em>. As you shall see, this seemingly obvious theorem requires a bit of work to prove. It is worth noting that in some axiomatic systems, the Well-Ordering Principle is sometimes taken as an axiom. However, in our case, the result follows from complete induction. Before stating the Well-Ordering Principle, we need an additional definition.</div>
