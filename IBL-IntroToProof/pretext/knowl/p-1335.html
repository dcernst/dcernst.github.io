<div class="para">We now turn our attention to some important properties that a function may or may not possess. Recall that if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a function, then every element in its domain is mapped to a unique element in the range. However, there are no restrictions on whether more than one element of the domain is mapped to the same element in the range. If each element in the range has a unique element in the domain mapping to it, then we say that the function is injective. Moreover, the range of a function is not required to be all of the codomain. If every element of the codomain has at least one element in the domain that maps to it, then we say that the function is surjective. Letâ€™s make these definitions a bit more precise.</div>
