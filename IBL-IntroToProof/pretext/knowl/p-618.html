<div class="para">Are these actual proofs? No! In fact, the second claim is not even true. If <span class="process-math">\(n=41\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(n^{2}+n+41=41^{2}+41+41=41(41+1+1)\text{,}\)</span> which is not prime since it has 41 as a factor. It turns out that the first claim is true, but what we wrote cannot be a proof since the same type of reasoning when applied to the second claim seems to prove something that is not actually true. We need a rigorous way of capturing “and so on” and a way to verify whether it really is “and so on.”</div>
