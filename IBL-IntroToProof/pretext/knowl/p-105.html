<div class="para">Notice that we have been tinkering with statements of the form “If…, then…”. Statements of this form are called <dfn class="terminology">conditional propositions</dfn>, which we revisit in the next section. The phrase that occurs after “If” but before “then” is called the <dfn class="terminology">hypothesis</dfn> while the phrase that occurs after “then” is called the <dfn class="terminology">conclusion</dfn>. For example, in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prob_divisibility_examples.html" title="Problem 2.8">Problem 2.8</a> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prob_first_divisibility_example.html" title="Item a">Item a</a>, “<span class="process-math">\(a|n\)</span>” is the hypothesis while “<span class="process-math">\(a|mn\)</span>” is the conclusion. Note that conditional propositions can also be written in the form “… if …”, where the conclusion is written before “if” and the hypothesis after. For example, we can rewrite <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prob_divisibility_examples.html" title="Problem 2.8">Problem 2.8</a> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prob_first_divisibility_example.html" title="Item a">Item a</a> as “<span class="process-math">\(a|mn\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(a|n\)</span>”. While the order of the hypothesis and conclusion have been reversed in the sentence, their roles have not.</div>
