<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Mathematics is about discovering proofs and writing them clearly and compellingly. The following guidelines apply whenever you write a proof. Keep these guidelines handy so that you may refer to them as you write your proofs.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">The burden of communication lies on you, not on your reader.</em> It is your job to explain your thoughts; it is not your reader’s job to guess them from a few hints. You are trying to convince a skeptical reader who does not believe you, so you need to argue with airtight logic in crystal clear language; otherwise the reader will continue to doubt. If you did not write something on the paper, then (a) you did not communicate it,(b) the reader did not learn it, and (c) the grader has to assume you did not know it in the first place.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tell the reader what you are proving or citing.</em> The reader does not necessarily know or remember what “Theorem 2.13” is. Even a professor grading a stack of papers might lose track from time to time. Therefore, the statement you are proving should be on the same page as the beginning of your proof. In most proofs you will want to refer to an earlier definition, problem, theorem, or corollary. In this case, you should reference the statement by number, but it is also helpful to the reader to summarize the statement you are citing. For example, you might write something like, ``By Theorem 2.3, the sum of two consecutive integers is odd, and so…."</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Use English words.</em> Although there will usually be equations or mathematical statements in your proofs, use English sentences to connect them and display their logical relationships. If you look at proofs in textbooks and research papers, you will see that they consist mostly of English words.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Use complete sentences.</em> If you wrote a history essay in sentence fragments, the reader would not understand what you meant; likewise in mathematics you must use complete sentences, with verbs, to convey your logical train of thought. Some complete sentences can be written purely in mathematical symbols, such as equations (e.g., <span class="process-math">\(a^3=b^{-1}\)</span>), inequalities (e.g., <span class="process-math">\(x\lt 5\)</span>), and other relations (like <span class="process-math">\(5\big|10\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(7\in\mathbb{Z}\)</span>). These statements usually express a relationship between two mathematical <em class="emphasis">objects</em>, like numbers or sets. However, it is considered bad style to begin a sentence with symbols. A common phrase to use to avoid starting a sentence with mathematical symbols is “We see that...”.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Show the logical connections among your sentences.</em> Use phrases like “Therefore”, “Thus”, “Hence”, “Then”, “since”, “because”, “if…, then…”, or “if and only if” to connect your sentences.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Know the difference between statements and objects.</em> A mathematical object is a <em class="emphasis">thing</em>, a noun, such as a set, an element, a number, an ordered pair, a vector space, etc. Objects either exist or do not exist. Statements, on the other hand, are mathematical <em class="emphasis">sentences</em>: they are either true or false. When you see or write a cluster of math symbols, be sure you know whether it is an object (e.g., “<span class="process-math">\(x^2+3\)</span>” ) or a statement (e.g., “<span class="process-math">\(x^2+3\lt 7\)</span>”). One way to tell is that every mathematical statement includes a verb, such as <span class="process-math">\(=\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\leq\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\in\text{,}\)</span> “divides”, etc.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">The symbol “<span class="process-math">\(=\)</span>” means “equals”.</em> Do not write <span class="process-math">\(A=B\)</span> unless you mean that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> actually equals <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> This guideline seems obvious, but there is a great temptation to be sloppy. In calculus, for example, some people might write <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^{2}=2x\)</span> (which is false), when they really mean that “if <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^{2}\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)=2x\text{.}\)</span>”</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Do not interchange <span class="process-math">\({=}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\({\implies}\text{.}\)</span></em> The equals sign connects two <em class="emphasis">objects</em>, as in “<span class="process-math">\(x^2=b\)</span>”; the symbol “<span class="process-math">\(\implies\)</span>” is an abbreviation for “implies” and connects two <em class="emphasis">statements</em>, as in “<span class="process-math">\(a+b=a \implies b=0\text{.}\)</span>” You should avoid using <span class="process-math">\(\implies\)</span> in formal write-ups of proofs.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Avoid logical symbols in your proofs.</em> Similar to <span class="process-math">\(\implies\text{,}\)</span> you should avoid using the logical symbols <span class="process-math">\(\forall, \exists, \vee, \wedge\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\logeq\)</span> in your formal write-ups. These symbols are useful for abbreviating in your scratch work.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Say exactly what you mean.</em> Just as <span class="process-math">\(=\)</span> is sometimes abused, so too people sometimes write <span class="process-math">\(A\in B\)</span> when they mean <span class="process-math">\(A\subseteq B\text{,}\)</span> or write <span class="process-math">\(a_{ij}\in A\)</span> when they mean that <span class="process-math">\(a_{ij}\)</span> is an entry in matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Mathematics is a very precise language, and there is a way to say exactly what you mean; find it and use it.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Do not utilize anything unproven.</em> Every statement in your proof should be something you <em class="emphasis">know</em> to be true. The reader expects your proof to be a series of statements, each proven by the statements that came before it. If you ever need to write something you do not yet know is true, you <em class="emphasis">must</em> preface it with words like “assume,” “suppose,” or “if” if you are temporarily assuming it, or with words like “we need to show that” or “we claim that” if it is your goal. Otherwise, the reader will think they have missed part of your proof.</div></li>
<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Write strings of equalities (or inequalities) in the proper order.</em> When your reader sees something like</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
A=B\leq C=D\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">they expect to understand easily why <span class="process-math">\(A=B\text{,}\)</span> why <span class="process-math">\(B\leq C\text{,}\)</span> and why <span class="process-math">\(C=D\text{,}\)</span> and they expect the point of the entire line to be the more complicated fact that <span class="process-math">\(A\leq D\text{.}\)</span> For example, if you were computing the distance <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> of the point <span class="process-math">\((12,5)\)</span> from the origin, you could write</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
d = \sqrt{12^2+5^2} = 13\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">In this string of equalities, the first equals sign is true by the Pythagorean theorem, the second is just arithmetic, and the conclusion is that the first item equals the last item: <span class="process-math">\(d=13\text{.}\)</span> A common error is to write strings of equations in the wrong order. For example, if you were to write “<span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{12^2+5^2}=13=d\)</span>”, your reader would understand the first equals sign, would be baffled as to how we know <span class="process-math">\(d=13\text{,}\)</span> and would be utterly perplexed as to why you wanted or needed to go through <span class="process-math">\(13\)</span> to prove that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{12^2+5^2}=d\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Avoid circularity.</em> Be sure that no step in your proof makes use of the conclusion!</div></li>
<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Do not write the proof backwards.</em> Beginning students often attempt to write “proofs” like the following, which attempts to prove that <span class="process-math">\(\tan^2(x)  = \sec^2(x) - 1\text{:}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\tan^2(x) \amp  = \sec^2(x) - 1\\
\left(\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\right)^2 \amp  = \frac{1}{\cos^2(x)} - 1\\
\frac{\sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)} \amp  =  \frac{1-\cos^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)}\\
\sin^2(x) \amp  = 1-\cos^2(x)\\
\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) \amp  = 1\\
1 \amp  = 1
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">Notice what has happened here: the student <em class="emphasis">started</em> with the conclusion, and deduced the true statement “<span class="process-math">\(1=1\text{.}\)</span>” In other words, they have proved “If <span class="process-math">\(\tan^2(x) = \sec^2(x) - 1\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(1=1\text{,}\)</span>” which is true but highly uninteresting. Now this is not a bad way of <em class="emphasis">finding</em> a proof. Working backwards from your goal often is a good strategy <em class="emphasis">on your scratch paper</em>, but when it is time to <em class="emphasis">write</em> your proof, you have to start with the hypotheses and work to the conclusion. Here is an example of a suitable proof for the desired result, where each expression follows from the one immediately proceeding it:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\sec^2(x) - 1 \amp  = \frac{1}{\cos^2(x)} - 1\\
\amp  = \frac{1-\cos^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)}\\
\amp  = \frac{\sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)}\\
\amp  = \left(\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\right)^2\\
\amp  = \left(\tan(x)\right)^2\\
\amp  = \tan^2(x)\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Be concise.</em> Many beginning proof writers err by writing their proofs too short, so that the reader cannot understand their logic. It is nevertheless quite possible to be too wordy, and if you find yourself writing a full-page essay, it is possible that you do not really have a proof, but just some intuition. When you find a way to turn that intuition into a formal proof, it will be much shorter.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Introduce every symbol you use.</em> If you use the letter “<span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span>” the reader should know exactly what <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is. Good phrases for introducing symbols include “Let <span class="process-math">\(n\in \mathbb{N}\text{,}\)</span>” “Let <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> be the least integer such that…,” “For every real number <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>…,” and “Suppose <span class="process-math">\(A\subseteq\mathbb{R}\ldots\)</span>”.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Use appropriate quantifiers (once).</em> When you introduce a variable <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\text{,}\)</span> it must be clear to your reader whether you mean “for all <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\)</span>” or just “for some <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\text{.}\)</span>” If you just say something like “<span class="process-math">\(y=x^2\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\text{,}\)</span>” the word “where” does not indicate whether you mean “for all” or “some”. Phrases indicating the quantifier “for all” include “Let <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\)</span>”; “for all <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\)</span>”; “for every <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\)</span>”; “for each <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\)</span>”; etc. Phrases indicating the quantifier “some” or “there exists” include “for some <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\)</span>”; “there exists an <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\)</span>”; “for a suitable choice of <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\)</span>”; etc. Once you have said “Let <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\text{,}\)</span>” the letter <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> has its meaning defined. You do not need to say “for all <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\)</span>” again, and you definitely should <em class="emphasis">not</em> say “let <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\)</span>” again.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Use a symbol to mean only one thing.</em> Once you use the letter <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> once, its meaning is fixed for the duration of your proof. You cannot use <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to mean anything else. There is an exception to this guideline. Sometimes a proof will include multiple subproofs that are distinct from each other. In this case, you can reuse a variable or symbol as long as it is clear to the reader that you have concluded with the previous subproof and have moved onto a new subproof.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Do not “prove by example.”</em> Most problems ask you to prove that something is true “for all” —You <em class="emphasis">cannot</em> prove this by giving a single example, or even a hundred. Your proof will need to be a logical argument that holds for <em class="emphasis">every example there possibly could be</em>. On the other hand, if the claim that you are trying to prove involves the existence of a mathematical object with a particular property, then providing a specific example is sufficient.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Write “Let <span class="process-math">\(x=\dots\text{,}\)</span>” not “Let <span class="process-math">\(\dots=x\text{.}\)</span>”</em> When you have an existing expression, say <span class="process-math">\(a^{2}\text{,}\)</span> and you want to give it a new, simpler name like <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> you should write “Let <span class="process-math">\(b=a^{2}\text{,}\)</span>” which means, “Let the new symbol <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> mean <span class="process-math">\(a^{2}\text{.}\)</span>” This convention makes it clear to the reader that <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is the brand-new symbol and <span class="process-math">\(a^{2}\)</span> is the old expression he/she already understands. If you were to write it backwards, saying “Let <span class="process-math">\(a^{2}=b\text{,}\)</span>” then your startled reader would ask, “What if <span class="process-math">\(a^{2}\neq b\text{?}\)</span>”</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Make your counterexamples concrete and specific.</em> Proofs need to be entirely general, but counterexamples should be concrete. When you provide an example or counterexample, make it as specific as possible. For a set, for example, you must specify its elements, and for a function you must specify the corresponding relation (possibly an algebraic rule) and its domain and codomain. Do not say things like “<span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> could be one-to-one but not onto”; instead, provide an actual function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> that is one-to-one but not onto.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Do not include examples in proofs.</em> Including an example very rarely adds anything to your proof. If your logic is sound, then it does not need an example to back it up. If your logic is bad, a dozen examples will not help it (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/pfbyexample.html" title="Item 19">Guideline 19</a>). There are only two valid reasons to include an example in a proof: if it is a <em class="emphasis">counterexample</em> disproving something, or if you are performing complicated manipulations in a general setting and the example is just to help the reader understand what you are saying.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Use scratch paper.</em> Finding your proof will be a long, potentially messy process, full of false starts and dead ends. Do all that on scratch paper until you find a real proof, and only then break out your clean paper to write your final proof carefully. Only sentences that actually contribute to your proof should be part of the proof. Do not just perform a “brain dump,” throwing everything you know onto the paper before showing the logical steps that prove the conclusion. <em class="emphasis">That is what scratch paper is for.</em>
