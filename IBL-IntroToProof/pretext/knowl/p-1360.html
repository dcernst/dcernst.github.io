<div class="para">How do we prove that a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is injective? We would need to show that every element in the range has a unique element from the domain that maps to it. First, notice that each element in the range can be written as <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> for at least one <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in the domain. To argue that each such element in domain is unique, we can suppose <span class="process-math">\(f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})\)</span> for arbitrary <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> in the domain and then work to show that <span class="process-math">\(x_{1}=x_{2}\text{.}\)</span> It is important to point out that when we suppose <span class="process-math">\(f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2\text{,}\)</span> we are not assuming that <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> are different. In general, when we write “Let <span class="process-math">\(x_1,x_2\in X\)</span>…”, we are leaving open the possibility that <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> are actually the same element. One could approach proving that a function is injective by utilizing a proof by contradiction, but this is not usually necessary.</div>
