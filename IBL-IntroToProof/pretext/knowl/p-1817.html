<div class="para">In mathematics there is very little freedom in definitions. Mathematics is a deductive theory; it is impossible to state and prove theorems without clear definitions of the mathematical terms. The definition of a term must completely, accurately, and unambiguously describe the term. Each word is chosen very carefully and the order of the words is critical. In the definition of continuity changing “there exists” to “for all,” changing the orders of quantifiers, changing <span class="process-math">\(\lt\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\leq\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(&gt;\text{,}\)</span> or changing <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> would completely change the meaning of the definition.</div>
