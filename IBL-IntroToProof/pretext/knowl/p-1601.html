<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(m,n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}\text{.}\)</span> A North-East lattice path from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((m,n)\)</span> is path in the plane from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((m,n)\)</span> consisting only steps either one unit North or one unit East. Note that every lattice path from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((m,n)\)</span> consists of a total of <span class="process-math">\(m+n\)</span> steps. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_lattice_path.html" title="Figure 9.6">Figure 9.6</a> shows a North-East lattice path from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((4,3)\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{L}_{m,n}\)</span> denote the set of North-East paths from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((m,n)\text{.}\)</span> For example, the North-East lattice path given in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_lattice_path.html" title="Figure 9.6">Figure 9.6</a> is an element of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{L}_{4,3}\text{.}\)</span> A binary string of length <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is an ordered list of consisting of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> entries where each entry is either 0 or 1. For example, <span class="process-math">\(0101100\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(0101001\)</span> are two different binary strings of length 7. Let <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{S}_k\)</span> denote the set of binary strings of length <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> For example, <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{S}_3=\{000, 100,010,001,110,101,011,111\}\text{.}\)</span> We claim that there is a bijection between <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{L}_{m,n}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{S}_{m+n}\text{.}\)</span> One such bijection is given by mapping a lattice path to the string that results by assigning each East step to 0 and each North step to 1 as we travel the path from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((m,n)\text{.}\)</span> Using this construction, the lattice path in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_lattice_path.html" title="Figure 9.6">Figure 9.6</a> would get mapped to the binary string <span class="process-math">\(0101100\text{.}\)</span> Since no two lattice paths will map to the same string, our mapping is injective. Given a string in <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{S}_{m+n}\text{,}\)</span> it is easy to find the lattice path in <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{L}_{m,n}\)</span> that maps to it, and so our function is also surjective. Thus, our mapping is a bijection between <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{L}_{m,n}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{S}_{m+n}\text{.}\)</span> We have shown that <span class="process-math">\(\card(\mathcal{L}_{m,n})=\card(\mathcal{S}_{m+n})\text{.}\)</span>
