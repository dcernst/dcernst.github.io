<div class="para">There are times when a theorem will make a claim about the <em class="emphasis">uniqueness</em> of a particular mathematical object. For example, in <a href="sec_AxiomsRealNumbers.html" class="internal" title="Section 5.1: Axioms of the Real Numbers">Section 5.1</a>, you will be asked to prove that both the additive and multiplicative identities (i.e, 0 and 1) are unique (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_unique_additive_identity.html" title="Theorem 5.2">Theorems 5.2</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_unique_multiplicative_identity.html" title="Theorem 5.3">Theorem 5.3</a>). As another example, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_FTA.html" title="Theorem 6.17: Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic">Theorem 6.17</a>) states that every natural number greater than 1 can be expressed uniquely (up to the order in which they appear) as the product of one or more primes. The typical approach to proving uniqueness is to suppose that there are potentially two objects with the desired property and then show that these objects are actually equal. Whether you approach this as a proof by contradiction is a matter of taste. It is common to use <span class="process-math">\(\tcboxmath{\exists!}\)</span> as a symbolic abbreviation for “there exists a unique… such that”.</div>
