<div class="para">According to naive set theory (i.e., approaching set theory using natural language as opposed to formal logic), any definable collection is a set. As Russell’s Paradox illustrates, this leads to problems. It turns out that any proposition can be proved from a contradiction, and hence the presence of contradictions like Russell’s Paradox would appear to be catastrophic for mathematics. Since set theory is often viewed as the basis for axiomatic development in mathematics, Russell’s Paradox calls the foundations of mathematics into question. In response to this threat, a great deal of research went into developing consistent axioms (i.e., free of contradictions) for set theory in the early 20th century. In 1908, <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Zermelo" target="_blank">Ernst Zermelo</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-18-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> (1871–1953) proposed a collection of axioms for set theory that avoided the inconsistencies of naive set theory. In the 1920s, adjustments to Zermelo’s axioms were made by <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Fraenkel" target="_blank">Abraham Fraenkel</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-19-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> (1891–1965), <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoralf_Skolem" target="_blank">Thoralf Skolem</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-20-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> (1887–1963), and Zermelo that resulted in a collection of nine axioms, called <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo-Fraenkel_set_theory" target="_blank">ZFC</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-21-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a>, where ZF stands for Zermelo and Fraenkel and C stands for the Axiom of Choice, which is one of the nine axioms. Loosely speaking, the Axiom of Choice states that given any collection of sets, each containing at least one element, it is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each set, even if the collection of sets is infinite. There was a period of time in mathematics when the Axiom of Choice was controversial, but nowadays it is generally accepted. There is a fascinating history concerning the Axiom of Choice, including its controversy. The Wikipedia page for the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice" target="_blank">Axiom of Choice</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-22-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a> is a good place to start if you are interested in learning more. There are several competing axiomatic approaches to set theory, but ZFC is considered the canonical collection of axioms by most mathematicians.</div>
