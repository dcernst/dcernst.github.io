<div class="para">Your progress will be fueled by your ability to wrestle with mathematical ideas and to prove theorems. As you work through the book, you will find that you have ideas for proofs, but you are unsure of them. Do not be afraid to tinker and make mistakes. You can always revisit your work as you become more proficient. Do not expect to do most things perfectly on your first—or even second or third—attempt. The material is too rich for a human being to completely understand immediately. Learning a new skill requires dedication and patience during periods of frustration. Moreover, solving genuine problems is difficult and takes time. But it is also rewarding!</div>
