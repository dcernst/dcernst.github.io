<em class="emphasis">The Naming Numbers Paradox.</em> Consider the claim: every natural number can be unambiguously described using no more than 50 characters (where a character is a–z, 0–9, and a “space”). For example, we can describe 9 as “9” or “nine” or “the square of the second prime number.” There are only 37 characters, so we can describe at most <span class="process-math">\(37^{50}\)</span> numbers, which is very large, but not infinite. So the statement is false. However, here is a “proof” that it is true. Let <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> be the set of natural numbers that can be unambiguously described using no more than 50 characters. For the sake of contradiction, suppose it is not all of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{N}\text{.}\)</span> Then there is a smallest number <span class="process-math">\(t\in\mathbb{N}\setminus S\text{.}\)</span> We can describe <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> as: the smallest natural number not in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> can be described using no more than 50 characters. So <span class="process-math">\(t\in S\text{,}\)</span> a contradiction.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="appendix_paradoxes.html#li-679">in-context</a></span>
