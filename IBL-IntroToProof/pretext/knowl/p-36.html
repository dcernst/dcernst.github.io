<div class="para">Up to this point, it is possible that your experience of mathematics has been about using formulas and algorithms. You are used to being asked to do things like: “solve for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>”, “take the derivative of this function”, “integrate this function”, etc. Accomplishing tasks like these usually amounts to mimicking examples that you have seen in class or in your textbook. However, this is only one part of mathematics. Mathematicians experiment, make conjectures, write definitions, and prove theorems. While engaging with the material contained in this book, we will learn about doing all of these things, especially writing proofs. Mathematicians are in the business of proving theorems and this is exactly our endeavor. Ultimately, the focus of this book is on producing and discovering mathematics.</div>
