<div class="para">When we attempt to define a function, it may not be clear without doing some work that our definition really does yield a function. If there is some potential ambiguity in the definition of a function that ends up not causing any issues, we say that the function is well defined. However, this phrase is a bit of misnomer since all functions are well defined. The issue of whether a description for a proposed function is well defined often arises when defining things in terms of representatives of equivalence classes, or more generally in terms of how an element of the domain is written. For example, the descriptions given in Parts (c) and (d) of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prob_not_well_defined.html" title="Problem 8.24">Problem 8.24</a> are not well defined. To show that a potentially ambiguous description for a function <span class="process-math">\(f:X\to Y\)</span> is well defined prove that if <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are two representations for the same element in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f(a)=f(b)\text{.}\)</span>
