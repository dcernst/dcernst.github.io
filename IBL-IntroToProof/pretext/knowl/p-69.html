<div class="para">It is important to point out that we are diving in head first here. As we get started, we are going to rely on your intuition and previous experience with proofs. This is intentional. What you will likely encounter is a general sense of what a proof entails, but you may not be able to articulate the finer details that you do and do not comprehend. There are going to be some subtle issues that you will be confronted with and one of our goals will be to elucidate as many of them as possible. We need to calibrate and develop an intellectual need for structure. You are encouraged to just try your hand at writing proofs for the problems in this section without too much concern for whether you are “doing it the right way.” In <a href="sec_Intro_to_Logic.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.2: Introduction to Logic">Section 2.2</a>, we will start over and begin to develop a formal foundation for the material in the remainder of the book. Once you have gained more experience and a better understanding of what a proof entails, you should consider returning to this section and reviewing your first attempts at writing proofs. In the meantime, see what you can do!</div>
