<div class="para">Give your friend some time to study the definition. Then take away the paper. Ten minutes later ask her to define rodomontade. Most likely she will be able to give a reasonably accurate definition. Maybe she’d say something like, “It is a speech or act or piece of writing created by a pompous or egotistical person who wants to show off how great they are.” It is unlikely that she will have quoted the OED word-for-word. In everyday English that is fine—you would probably agree that your friend knows the meaning of the rodomontade. This is because most definitions are <em class="emphasis">descriptive</em>. They describe the common usage of a word.</div>
