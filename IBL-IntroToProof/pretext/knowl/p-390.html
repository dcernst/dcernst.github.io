<div class="para">If we think of a set as a box potentially containing some stuff, then the empty set is a box with nothing in it. One assumption we will make is that for any set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(A\notin A\text{.}\)</span> The language associated to sets is specific. We will often define sets using the following notation, called <dfn class="terminology">set-builder notation</dfn>:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\tcboxmath{S=\{x \in A\mid P(x)\}}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(P(x)\)</span> is some predicate statement involving <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> The first part “<span class="process-math">\(x \in A\)</span>” denotes what type of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is being considered. The predicate to the right of the vertical bar (not to be confused with “divides” ) determines the condition(s) that each <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> must satisfy in order to be a member of the set. This notation is read as “The set of all <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(P(x)\text{.}\)</span>” As an example, the set <span class="process-math">\(\{x\in \mathbb{N}\mid x \mbox{ is even and } x\geq 8\}\)</span> describes the collection of even natural numbers that are greater than or equal to 8.</div>
