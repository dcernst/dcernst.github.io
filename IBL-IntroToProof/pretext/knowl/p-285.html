<div class="para">If you look closely, many of the theorems that we have encountered up until this point were of the form <span class="process-math">\(A(x)\implies B(x)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(A(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B(x)\)</span> are predicates. For example, consider <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_n_even_implies_n_2_even.html" title="Theorem 2.2">Theorem 2.2</a>, which states, “If <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is an even integer, then <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is an even integer.” In this case, “<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is an even integer” and “<span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is an even integer” are both predicates. So, it would be reasonable to assume that the entire theorem statement is a predicate. However, it is standard practice to interpret the sentence <span class="process-math">\(A(x)\implies B(x)\)</span> to mean <span class="process-math">\((\forall x)(A(x)\implies B(x))\)</span> (where the universe of discourse for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> needs to be made clear). We can also retool such statements to “hide” the implication. In particular, <span class="process-math">\((\forall x)(A(x)\implies B(x))\)</span> has the same meaning as <span class="process-math">\((\forall x \in U')B(x)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> is the collection of items from the universe of discourse <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> that makes <span class="process-math">\(A(x)\)</span> true. For example, we could rewrite the statement of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_n_even_implies_n_2_even.html" title="Theorem 2.2">Theorem 2.2</a> as “For every even integer <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is even.”</div>
