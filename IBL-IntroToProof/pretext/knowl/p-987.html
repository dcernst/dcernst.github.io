<div class="para">Contrary to its name, our statement of the Division Algorithm is not actually an algorithm, but this is the theoremâ€™s traditional name. However, there is an algorithm buried in this theorem. If <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is nonnegative, repeatedly subtract <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> until we obtain an integer value that lies between 0 (inclusive) and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> (exclusive). The resulting value is the remainder <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> while the number of times that <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is subtracted is the quotient <span class="process-math">\(q\text{.}\)</span> On the other hand, if <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is negative, repeatedly add <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> until we obtain an integer value that lies between 0 (inclusive) and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> (exclusive). Again, the resulting value is <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span> However, in this case, we take <span class="process-math">\(-q\)</span> to be the number of times that <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is added, so that <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> (a negative value) is the quotient.</div>
