<div class="para">Intuitively, the Axiom of Choice guarantees the existence of mathematical objects that are obtained by a sequence of choices. It applies to both the finite and infinite setting. As an analogy, we can think of each <span class="process-math">\(A_{\alpha}\)</span> as a drawer in a dresser and each <span class="process-math">\(a_{\alpha}\)</span> as an article of clothing chosen from the drawer identified with <span class="process-math">\(A_{\alpha}\text{.}\)</span> The Axiom of Choice is surprisingly powerful, sometimes leading to unexpected consequences. It often gets used in subtle ways that mathematicians are not always explicit with. We will require the Axiom of Choice when proving <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_infiniteSetTFAE.html" title="Theorem 9.32">Theorems 9.32</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_countable_union_of_countable_sets.html" title="Theorem 9.49">Theorem 9.49</a>. When proving these theorems, be on the lookout for where you are invoking the Axiom of Choice.</div>
