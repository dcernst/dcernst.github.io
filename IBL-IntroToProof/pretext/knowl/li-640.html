<em class="emphasis">The burden of communication lies on you, not on your reader.</em> It is your job to explain your thoughts; it is not your readerâ€™s job to guess them from a few hints. You are trying to convince a skeptical reader who does not believe you, so you need to argue with airtight logic in crystal clear language; otherwise the reader will continue to doubt. If you did not write something on the paper, then (a) you did not communicate it,(b) the reader did not learn it, and (c) the grader has to assume you did not know it in the first place.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="appendix_elements_of_style.html#li-640">in-context</a></span>
