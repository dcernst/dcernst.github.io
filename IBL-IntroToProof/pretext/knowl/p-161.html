<div class="para">In accordance with <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_logical_connectives.html" title="Definition 2.18">Definition 2.18</a> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_conditional.html" title="Item d">Item d</a>, a conditional proposition <span class="process-math">\(A\implies B\)</span> is only false when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false. Perhaps you are bothered by the fact that <span class="process-math">\(A\implies B\)</span> is true when <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is false no matter what the truth value of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is. The thing to keep in mind is that the truth value of <span class="process-math">\(A\implies B\)</span> relies on a very specific definition and may not always agree with the colloquial use of “If…, then…” statements that we encounter in everyday language. For example, if someone says, “If you break the rules, then you will be punished”, the speaker likely intends the statement to be interpreted as ``You will be punished if and only if you break the rules." In logic and mathematics, we aim to remove such ambiguity by explicitly saying exactly what we mean. For our purposes, we should view a conditional proposition as a contract or obligation. If the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true, the contract is not violated. On the other hand, if the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false, then the contract is broken.</div>
