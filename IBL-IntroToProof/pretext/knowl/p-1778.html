<div class="para">In this string of equalities, the first equals sign is true by the Pythagorean theorem, the second is just arithmetic, and the conclusion is that the first item equals the last item: <span class="process-math">\(d=13\text{.}\)</span> A common error is to write strings of equations in the wrong order. For example, if you were to write “<span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{12^2+5^2}=13=d\)</span>”, your reader would understand the first equals sign, would be baffled as to how we know <span class="process-math">\(d=13\text{,}\)</span> and would be utterly perplexed as to why you wanted or needed to go through <span class="process-math">\(13\)</span> to prove that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{12^2+5^2}=d\text{.}\)</span>
