<div class="para">In light of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_logical_form_for_iff.html" title="Theorem 2.29">Theorem 2.29</a>, if we want to prove a biconditional of the form <span class="process-math">\(A\logeq B\text{,}\)</span> we need to prove both <span class="process-math">\(A\implies B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\implies A\text{.}\)</span> You should always make it clear to the reader when you are proving each implication. One approach is to label each subproof with “<span class="process-math">\((\implies)\)</span>” and “<span class="process-math">\((\Longleftarrow)\)</span>” (including the parentheses), respectively. Occasionally, you will discover that the proof of one implication is exactly the reverse of the proof of the other implication. If this happens to be the case, you may skip writing two subproofs and simply write a single proof that chains together each step using biconditionals. Such proofs will almost always be shorter, but can be challenging to write in an eloquent way. It is always a safe bet to write a separate subproof for each implication.</div>
