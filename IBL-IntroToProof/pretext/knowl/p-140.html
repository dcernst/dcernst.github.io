<div class="para">It is worth pointing out that definitions in mathematics are typically written in the form “<span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span>” (or “<span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> provided that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span>” or “<span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span>”), where <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> contains the term or phrase we are defining and <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> provides the meaning of the concept we are defining. In the case of definitions, we should always interpret “<span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span>” as describing precisely the collection of “objects” (e.g., numbers, sets, functions, etc.) that should be identified with the term or phrase we are defining. That is, if an object does not meet the condition specified in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> then it is never referred to by the term or phrase we are defining. Some authors will write definitions in the form “<span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span>”. However, a definition is not at all the same kind of statement as a usual biconditional since one of the two sides is undefined until the definition is made. A definition is really a statement that the newly defined term or phrase is synonymous with a previously defined concept.</div>
