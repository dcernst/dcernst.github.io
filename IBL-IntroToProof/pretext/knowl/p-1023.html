<div class="para">The Pythagoreans were an ancient secret society that followed their spiritual leader: Pythagoras of Samos (c. 570–495 BCE). The Pythagoreans believed that the way to spiritual fulfillment and to an understanding of the universe was through the study of mathematics. They believed that all of mathematics, music, and astronomy could be described via whole numbers and their ratios. In modern mathematical terms they believed that all numbers are rational. Attributed to Pythagoras is the saying, “Beatitude is the knowledge of the perfection of the numbers of the soul.” And their motto was “All is number.”</div>
