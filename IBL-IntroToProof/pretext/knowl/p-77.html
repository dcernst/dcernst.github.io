<div class="para">Notice that we framed the definition of “even” in terms of multiplication as opposed to division. When tackling theorems and problems involving even or odd, be sure to make use of our formal definitions and not some of the well-known divisibility properties. For now, you should avoid arguments that involve statements like, “even numbers have no remainder when divided by two” or ``the last digit of an even number is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8." Also notice that the notions of even and odd apply to zero and negative numbers. In particular, zero is even since <span class="process-math">\(0=2\cdot 0\text{,}\)</span> where it is worth emphasizing that the occurrence of <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> on the righthand side of the equation is an integer. As another example, we see that <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> is odd since <span class="process-math">\(-1=2(-1)+1\text{.}\)</span> Despite the fact that <span class="process-math">\(-1=2(-1/2)\text{,}\)</span> this does not imply that <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> is also even since <span class="process-math">\(-1/2\)</span> is not an integer. For the remainder of this section, you may assume that every integer is either even or odd but never both.</div>
