<div class="para">The items labeled as <dfn class="terminology">Definition</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">Example</dfn> are meant to be read and digested. However, the items labeled as <dfn class="terminology">Problem</dfn>, <dfn class="terminology">Theorem</dfn>, and <dfn class="terminology">Corollary</dfn> require action on your part. Items labeled as <dfn class="terminology">Problem</dfn> are sort of a mixed bag. Some Problems are computational in nature and aimed at improving your understanding of a particular concept while others ask you to provide a counterexample for a statement if it is false or to provide a proof if the statement is true. Items with the <dfn class="terminology">Theorem</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">Corollary</dfn> designation are mathematical facts and the intention is for you to produce a valid proof of the given statement. The main difference between a theorem and a corollary is that corollaries are typically statements that follow quickly from a previous theorem. In general, you should expect corollaries to have very short proofs. However, that does not mean that you cannot produce a more lengthy yet valid proof of a corollary.</div>
