<div class="para">In the previous section, we jumped in head first and attempted to prove several theorems in the context of number theory without a formal understanding of what it was we were doing. Likely, many issues bubbled to the surface. What is a proof? What sorts of statements require proof? What should a proof entail? How should a proof be structured? Let’s take a step back and do a more careful examination of what it is we are actually doing. In the the next two sections, we will introduce the basics of <em class="emphasis">propositional logic</em>—also referred to as <em class="emphasis">propositional calculus</em> or sometimes <em class="emphasis">zeroth-order logic</em>.</div>
