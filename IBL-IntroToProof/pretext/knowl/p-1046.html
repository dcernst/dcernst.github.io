<div class="para">Relations can be represented using digraphs. A <dfn class="terminology">digraph</dfn> (short for <dfn class="terminology">directed graph</dfn>) is a discrete graph that consists of a set of vertices connected by edges, where the edges have a direction associated with them. If <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is a relation from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> then the elements of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are the vertices of the digraph and there is a directed edge from <span class="process-math">\(a\in A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(b\in B\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\)</span> is in the relation <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> (i.e., <span class="process-math">\(aR b\)</span>). We can visually represent digraphs by using dots to represent the vertices and arrows to represent directed edges. We will not make a distinction between a digraph and its visual representation. Utilizing a digraph to represent a relation may be impractical if there is a large number of vertices or directed edges.</div>
