<div class="para">In the previous section, we jumped in head first and attempted to prove several theorems in the context of number theory without a formal understanding of what it was we were doing. Likely, many issues bubbled to the surface. What is a proof? What sorts of statements require proof? What should a proof entail? How should a proof be structured? Let’s take a step back and do a more careful examination of what it is we are actually doing. In the next two sections, we will introduce the basics of <dfn class="terminology">propositional logic</dfn>—also referred to as <dfn class="terminology">propositional calculus</dfn> or sometimes <dfn class="terminology">zeroth-order logic</dfn>.</div>
